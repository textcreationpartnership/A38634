            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Revelation</hi> is the moſt excellent of the P ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Books contained in the Scripture, as being the Abſtract of them all; and therefore (as the beſt things are moſt liable to abuſe,) it hath been ſhamefully intreated by the greateſt part of thoſe, that have undertaken to explain the ſame. For it ſeemeth by their Expoſitions, that they imagine this to be ſuch a Portion of holy Writ, whereon men are onely to exerciſe their Fancies, and to ſuſpend the uſe of Reaſon whileſt they inquire into the ſenſe thereof Neither did I ever finde ſuch monſtrous Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons impoſed on any other Book, whether ſacred or profane. For inſtance, when <hi>John</hi> doth in the firſt Chapter wiſh Grace and Peace to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia, from the ſeven Spirits that are before the Throne of God,</hi> by theſe (ſay they) is meant the holy Spirit, who is ſaid to be ſeven, either becauſe of his manifold operations, or becauſe he wrought in the ſeven Churches. But by what inſtance taken out of any Authour, either ſacred or profane, can they avouch ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation? Who ever heard that a ſingle perſon (as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is) ſhould either for his many Works, or for his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:104168:3"/>in ſundry places, be termed Seven? And how ſhould any man ever reach the meaning of our word, if took to our ſelves the liberty of ſpeaking thus? Again, when it is in the <hi>11.</hi> Chapter ſpoken of <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> theſe (ſay they) are the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or Magiſtracy and Miniſtry. But where in the Scripture are two Witneſſes that propheſie, or two Prophets (for ſo the Witneſſes are there in the <hi>10.</hi> Verſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſtyled) put otherwiſe than for two men endued with a proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tick ſpirit? Yea, can it without the greateſt abſurdity be ſaid of any but two men, that <hi>they propheſie clad in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth?</hi> that <hi>if any one goeth about to hurt them, Fire iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth out of their Mouths and devoureth their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?</hi> that <hi>they have Power to ſhut Heaven, and turn the Waters into Blood, and ſmite the Earth with every Plague as often as they pleaſe?</hi> that <hi>when they have finiſhed their Teſtimony, they are killed, and their dead Bodies lie three Days and an half in the Street of a certain City?</hi> In fine, that <hi>after the three Days and an half the Spirit of Life from God enters into them, ſo that they ſtand upon their Feet, and afterwards aſcend up into Heaven, in a Cloud, whileſt their Adverſaries ſtand looking on them?</hi> Is it poſsible for the wit of man with any congruity to Reaſon, and to the words of the Text, to draw theſe things either to the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or to the Magiſtracy and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? Grant once that we may with our myſtical Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons evade the literal Truth of things ſo plainly delivered in the Scripture, I would fain know what certainty is to be had there, or how any thing ſhould ever be proved from thence? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are told in the Hiſtory of the two Witneſſes, that <hi>they ſhall propheſie a thouſand two hundred and ſixty Days.</hi> This term of time (ſay they) ſignifieth a thouſand two hundred and ſixty Years: a Day, according to the uſage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, being put for a Year to which purpoſe they allege: <hi>Numb. 14.3, 34.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>Your Children ſhall wander in the Wilderneſs forty Years, and bear your
<pb facs="tcp:104168:3"/>Whoredoms, untill your Carcaſes be waſted in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. After the number of the Days in the which ye ſearched the Land, even forty Days (each Day for a Year) ſhall ye bear your iniqu ties, even forty Years. And</hi> Ezek. <hi>4.5, 6.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>I have laid upon thee the Years of their iniquity, according to the number of the Days, three hundred and ninety Days, ſo ſhalt thou bear the iniquity of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And when thou haſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, lie again on thy right ſide, and thou ſhalt bear the iniquity of the Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>forty Days: I have appointed thee each Day for a Year.</hi> But in neither of theſe two places are Days to be drawn out into Years. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when it is ſaid in <hi>Numbers,</hi> that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were forty Days a ſearching the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they ſpent forty Years about it: which every one ſeeth to be abſurd. Likewiſe when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> lay upon his left ſide three hundred and ninety Days for the iniquity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and on his right ſide forty Days for the iniquity of <hi>Judah,</hi> by this reckoning he would have lien on his ſides four hundred and thirty Years. Wherefore the words in <hi>Numbers</hi> import no more, than that, whereas the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had ſpent forty Days in ſearching the Land, their Children ſhould anſwerably thereunto wander forty Years in the Wilderneſs. So alſo doth the paſſage in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſignifie, that foraſmuch as <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> had now gone a whoring from God for the ſpace of four hundred and thirty Years, the Prophet ſhould accordingly lie four hundred and thirty Days upon his ſides, to bear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. I conclude therefore, that it is contrary both to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reaſon to underſtand by the thouſand two hundred and ſixty Days that the Witneſſes ſhall propheſie, any other than ſuch Days as are properly ſo called, conſiſting of four and twenty Hours a piece. Finally, it is ſaid of the Carcaſes of the two Witneſſes, that <hi>they ſhall he unburied three Days and an half in the Street of the great City, where our Lord was ſlain,</hi> (which is the moſt evident deſcription of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:104168:4"/>that can be given) this City (ſay they) is meant of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe our Lord was put to death by the <hi>Roman</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. 'Tis true indeed that a Deputy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did crucifie our Saviour Chriſt, but may it therefore be affirmed, that he was crucified at <hi>Rome?</hi> Are we wont to ſay that a thing is done at ſuch a place, when it is done onely by the Authority of him that hath his imperial Seat there? What man that was in his wits, did ever expreſs things in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Certainly, did the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeak at ſuch a rate as theſe men imagine, it would be the moſt ridiculous piece that ever was penned, and the Authour thereof ſo far from being a Divine by way of excellency, (for ſo <hi>John</hi> of right is ſtyled) as that he would not deſerve a rank among ſober Writers. Neither am I a little troubled, when I ſee men thus to dally with the Word of God, and make choice of no fitter a ſubject, whereon to vent their follies, than this incomparable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
            <p>I have the more largely inſiſted upon the Hiſtory of the two Witneſſes, becauſe of the frequent injury offered to that part above all the reſt of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For if ſome Chriſtian State or Potentate cruſh any party whatſoever pretending to Religion, or ſome eminent perſons of the ſame, then it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently given out by the favourers of that party, that now the the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is riſen, hath ſlain the Witneſſes. Thus the ſacred Word of God, that was given to a far better purpoſe, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs it ſelf in our private Quarrels, and be forced to ſpeak as we ſtand affected. But it will perhaps be here objected, that I who am ſo ready to obſerve the ſtrange gloſſes that other men impoſe on the Hiſtory of the two Witneſſes, ſeem not in the mean time to take notice how uncouth mine own opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that ſlayeth them, whileſt I hold him (as appeareth by the following Treatiſe) to be ſuch a man as ſhall ariſe from the Dead to reign, before he embrueth his Hands in the Blood of the ſaid Witneſſes. To which I anſwer, that though my Tenet be ſtrange as to the Apprehenſions that Men
<pb facs="tcp:104168:4"/>generally have touching the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> yet is it very facile and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, if you reſpect the words of the Text it ſelf. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Angel explaining the Myſtery of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> Chap. <hi>17.9, 10, 11.</hi> plainly telleth us, that he is a King, when <hi>John</hi> ſaith of the two Witneſſes, Chap. <hi>11.7.</hi> that <hi>the Beaſt which aſcendeth out of the bottomleſs Pit ſhall ſlay them;</hi> what other ſenſe can rationally be put upon the words, than that <hi>the King, which is decyphered by the Beaſt, and ariſeth from the Dead, ſhall kill the Witneſſes?</hi> And into what Abſurdities muſt he plunge himſelf, that goeth about to faſten another meaning on the place! But of this matter I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at large in the enſuing Expoſition, to which I refer the Reader for further ſatisfaction therein.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a taſte of the exotick Interpretations that are uſually forced upon the <hi>Reve ation,</hi> I will now open the original Cauſes from whence they proceed, reducing them to three Heads, namely, that men think the whole Book to be an Allegory, and to contain a Prediction of that which ſhall happen to the Churches in all Ages of the World, and to have for its principal ſcope the diſcovery of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt of which three Particulars, I anſwer, that the <hi>Revelation</hi> cannot be a meer Allegory, ſeeing it is fraught with Evangelical Precepts, Promiſes, and Threats, and alſo with ſundry clear and evident paſſages touching the Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government of the Chriſt, the Univerſal Judgement, and the Glorification of the Saints in the <hi>new Jeruſalem;</hi> which laſt being the chiefeſt point of all the Goſpel, is no leſs than three times confirmed by the teſtimony, partly of Angels, and partly of God himſelf, which aſſureth us that the ſayings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded concerning the ſame, are <hi>faithful and true.</hi> Which (as I afterwards evince in mine Expoſition) is no other, than if it had been ſaid, <hi>They are perſpicuous and plain, and to be taken as the words ſound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſecond I ſay, that it is preſumption for us to deviſe with our ſelves how much it is meet for God to diſcover touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:104168:5"/>things to come, and ſo to change days into years, and years into ages, and particular men into a ſucceſſion of men continued throughout many generations, as it hath been the cuſtom of interpreters to do: we ought rather to content our ſelves with what is recorded in the Scripture and to follow the plain doctrine thereof, as knowing that if God vouchſafed to foretell but one remarkable event, which was to happen in all the intermediate ſpace between the penning of this book and the conſummation of the world, it was a great favour, and which we could not have required of him. How much more then doth it become us to reſt ſatisfied, and thank Almighty God who hath been pleaſed to reveal ſo many choice ſecrets, as are contained in this book touching the ſtate of future times? whoſever therefore ſhall conſider well the ſixth <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the prediction of things to happen after the days of <hi>Domitian,</hi> (whoſe Tyranny had been hinted, <hi>Chap. 3.10.</hi>) doth begin and compare it with Hiſtory, ſhall finde that it reacheth no further than <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great. Likewiſe the things foretold from the beginning of the ſeventh <hi>Chapter</hi> to the end of the nineteenth are all (ſave ſomewhat that ſhall happen before the death of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and whereof mention is made in the tenth <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſeventeenth <hi>Chapter</hi>) to be accompliſhed within the compaſs of that age wherein he ſhall riſe again from the dead. And of this I give a touch in the following expoſition. So that from the Reign of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> unto the age aforeſaid is a vaſt gap, without the intimation of any thing that ſhall intervene.</p>
            <p>To the third I anſwer, that if <hi>John</hi> in penning the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> had intended to detect <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> he would no doubt have named him, elſe how could he expect that any man ſhould ever be able to fathome his meaning as to this matter. Which reaſon is the more forceible in that we ſee him ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make mention of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in his Epiſtles. And would there (think ye) have been ſo deep ſilence concerning him throughout the <hi>Revelation,</hi> had <hi>John</hi> there deſigned to paint
<pb facs="tcp:104168:5"/>him out more fully then before? But as men have been too quick ſighted in ſpying <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> where he was not indeed to be found, ſo have they on the contrary been very purblinde when they came to thoſe places, wherein he was expoſed to open view. Wherefore that we may at length attain to the right notion of Antichriſt, let us mark in the firſt place that John did not by <hi>Antichriſt</hi> intend any particular perſon, but many deceivers: to which purpoſe let us hear what he ſaith, <hi>1</hi> Epiſtle <hi>4.3, 4. This is that ſpirit of</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>whereof ye have heard that it ſhould come, and even now already is it in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.</hi> The word <hi>them,</hi> as will eaſily appear by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the circumſtances of the place, hath no other antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent but <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and therefore no ſingle perſon was meant by him. But if this allegation ſhould ſeem to any one to carry ſome doubt and uncertainty with it, the ſeventh <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſecond Epiſtle will ſoon remove all ſcruple, and clearly prove our aſſertion. For it is there ſaid, <hi>Many deceivers are come into the world, who confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come into the world, who confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh. This is the deceiver</hi> (ſo the Greek hath it) <hi>and the Antichriſt.</hi> In the next place, ſeeing it is now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that by the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> many deceivers are underſtood, let us ſearch out what manner of deceivers they muſt be, to whom this appellation agreeth. If we conſult with interpreters and obſerve how variouſly they define the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> we ſhall be at a loſs concerning that which wee ſeek after, only we ſhall finde they ſo order the buſineſs, as that if they had a ſpight againſt any man upon a Religious accompt, they could transform him into <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> at their pleaſure. Wherefore leaving them, let us betake our ſelves again to the touchſtone of truth, the holy Scripture, and ſee how it defineth <hi>Antichriſt. John</hi> the only ſacred writer that is to guide us in this, as well as in the other particulars, deſcribing <hi>Antichriſt Chap. 2.</hi> of this firſt <hi>Epiſtle, verſe 22.</hi> doth (if his words be exactly rendred according to the Greek) ſpeak thus, <hi>Who is the liar, but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt? this is the Antichriſt
<pb facs="tcp:104168:6"/>that denieth the Father and the Son.</hi> And <hi>Chap 4.3.</hi> he ſaith thus, <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God, and this is that ſpirit of Antichriſt.</hi> And <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.7. (which place was before quoted to another purpoſe) he ſaith, <hi>Many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers are come into the world, who confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh. This is the deceiver and the Antichriſt.</hi> From which teſtimonies it is evident, that only he who denieth <hi>that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> is an <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> What peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is it then that they who make the ſame confeſsion touching Chriſt and his coming in the fleſh, ſhould upon ſome other difference about <hi>Religion</hi> reproachfully term one another <hi>Antichriſtians!</hi> And how contrary is this to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scripture it ſelf, which all ſhould make the rule of their words and actions!</p>
            <p>Theſe things being unfolded, it is an eaſie matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my deſign in writing this Eſſay, which is to enure men more cloſely to follow the Text of the holy ſcipture, as in other parts thereof, ſo eſpecially in the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where men are wont to be looſe and exorbitant in a more then ordinary manner, as if they ſtrove who ſhould depart furtheſt off from the literal ſenſe of that prophecy. For bearing in minde continually that rule of interpreting, which all that are of a ſound judgement readily admit, <hi>That we are not to recede from the letter of the ſacred Text, without evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent neceſſity,</hi> (which is when the literal interpretation is repugnant either to our ſences, or to the ſcope of the place, or to a greater number of plain Texts to the contrary) I have (as I perſwade my ſelf) given a ſounder and clearer expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this difficult prophecy then is commonly to be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. I have alſo with the ſame labour cut off all thoſe forced and factions applications of things mentioned in the ſaid book to the Pope, which too juſtly render the reformed Religion ſuſpected to Papiſts, who are apt enought to think that ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:104168:6"/>violent wreſting of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to diſparage them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from a want of ſolid Arguments to confute their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For mine own part, there is no man that doth abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate all Popiſh Superſtitions more than my ſelf, nor is at a wider diſtance from them; yet doth not the deteſtation of them ſo tranſport me, as that I am thereby induced to abuſe the holy Scripture, to the end I may render Papiſts more odious. For ſuch a way of proceeding is wont to work a contrary effect, cauſing men, when they once perceive the Papiſts to be ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably wronged, to imagine that their Religion is wholly true and harmleſs, otherwiſe what need was there of ſo far fetched Allegations to diſgrace them? I have further obſerved, that there is hardly found amongſt us any man of unſound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in matter of Religion, but preſently calleth in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to his aid, torturing the rare Myſteries thereof to get ſomething out of them, that may give a colour to his Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. Wherefore I made this account with my ſelf, that by opening away to the plain and genuine underſtanding of that Book, I might poſsibly give a check to ſuch groundleſs fancies, and hinder them from peſtering the World without controll in the time to come. I deſire therefore all that ſhall light on this Eſſay to peruſe it with patience, and not paſs ſentence thereon untill they have read it quite through, and well conſidered the connexion of the ſeveral parts thereof, and the congruity of the things therein delivered, both with Scripture and Reaſon: and if they perceive the worth and ſovereign uſe of the many ſecrets therein diſcovered, let them give the whole glory of them unto God, who is the Father of Lights, both of that wherewith the Pen-men of the holy Scripture, and alſo of that wherewith the ſound Interpreters of the ſame are enlightned.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the Beaſt here mentioned is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a Man, according to the Expoſition of <hi>John</hi> himſelf, who ſaith in the 18. Verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Here is wiſdom, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the Beaſt, for it is the number of a Man.</hi> For if the Number of the Beaſt be the Number of a Man, by the Beaſt muſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104168:8"/>needs be meant a Man, otherwiſe his Number would be the Number of ſomething elſe, and not of a Man. Again, the Beaſt ſignifieth ſuch a Man as ſhall be alſo a King, and that an univerſal one. A King, becauſe it is ſaid <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.10. that <hi>the fifth Angel poured out his Vial upon the Throne</hi> (ſo it is in the <hi>Greek</hi>) <hi>of the Beaſt.</hi> For if the Beaſt hath a Throne, he is a King, it being proper to Kings to ſit upon Thrones. Thus the four and twenty Elders, which <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. are ſaid to ſit upon Thrones, do <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.10. acknowledge themſelves to have been made Kings. Yea, it is ſubjoyned in the fore-cited paſſage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.10. that <hi>the Kingdom of the Beaſt was darkened.</hi> But if his Kingdom was darkened, then it undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that he is a King, in as much as a Kingdom and a King are Relatives.</p>
                  <p>But it is yet ſuperabundantly manifeſt, that by the Beaſt is meant a King, from the Expoſition of the Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.10, 11. where he ſaith, <hi>And there were ſeven Kings, five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace. And the Beaſt that was and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the ſeven.</hi> When he here ſaith, after he had ſpoken of ſeven Kings, that the Beaſt is the eighth, it muſt of neceſſity be meant the eighth King. Now that this King is to be an univerſal one, appeareth from the 7. Verſe of this Chapter, where it is ſaid of him, diſguized under the name of the Beaſt, that <hi>Power</hi> (Greek <hi>Authority</hi>) <hi>was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</hi> Yea, the univerſal Monarchy of the Beaſt is ſufficiently hinted to us by his riſing out of the Sea. For if by <hi>Waters</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Interpretation given by the Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.15. are meant <hi>Peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues,</hi> then ſuitably by the <hi>Sea,</hi> which is the general confluence of the Waters, ought to be underſtood the univerſality of Mankinde concurring to the advancement
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104168:8"/>of that univerſal Monarch, decyphered by the Beaſt. This Interpretation of mine is further confirmed by the ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the Angel, explaining to him the Viſion of the four great Beaſts that came up out of the Sea, ſaith <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Theſe great Beaſts, which are four, are four Kings which ſhall ariſe out of the Earth.</hi> But thoſe four Kings (as every one that is acquainted with Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory can tell) are the Founders of the four univerſal Kingdoms, namely, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> of the <hi>Caldean, Cyrus</hi> of the <hi>Perſian, Alexander</hi> of the <hi>Greek, Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> of the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When it is further ſaid, that <hi>the Beaſt had ſeven Heads and ten Horns,</hi> by the ſeven Heads (according to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17 9,10.) are meant ſeven Hills, whereon <hi>Rome</hi> (the Birth-place of the Beaſt, as I ſhall hereafter prove) is ſeated: and by the ten Horns (as the ſame Interpreter goeth on to explain it, Verſe the 12. of the fore-ſaid Chapter) are meant ten Kings, which ſhall receive authority as Kings for a while with the Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the Crowns that are upon the Horns, do of themſelves without any Interpretation ſufficiently ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie that by the Horns Kings are underſtood. But of theſe things more largely, when we come to the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chapter aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Finally, as for the name of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> that was upon the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt, had it been the will of God that we ſhould know it, he would have cauſed <hi>John</hi> to ſet it down: But ſeeing it is neither here nor elſewhere expreſſed, or ſo much as hinted, we ſhould be content to be ignorant thereof, and not betray the impatient diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our mindes by gheſſing at it.</p>

                  <p>So great is the fierceneſs of the Beaſt (whereby, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved, an univerſal Monarch is underſtood) that it is compoſed of ſundry Beaſts, his Body being like to that of a Leopard, whoſe ſwiftneſs in ſeiſing on the Prey is noted in the Scripture, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Their Horſes are ſwifter than the Leopards:</hi> as alſo his lying in wait, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.7. <hi>As a Leopard by the way will I obſerve them.</hi> His Feet or Paws are like to thoſe of a Bear; whoſe chief ſtrength conſiſteth in his Paws, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. <hi>The Lord that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me from the Paw of the Bear.</hi> His Mouth is like to that of a Lion, whoſe ravening with his Mouth is alſo marked in the Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <hi>I was delivered out of the Mouth of a Lion.</hi> Neither is this all, but the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon (whereby the Devil is to be underſtood, as <hi>John</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expoundeth it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.9.) giveth to the Beaſt his Power, which being a Power above Nature, the Beaſt is thereby ſtrengthened to atchieve ſuch things, as no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and humane Power can reach unto. The Devil alſo imparteth to the Beaſt his Throne, and conſequently his Dominion over the other evil Spirits, of whom he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prince, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. But of this alſo we will ſpeak more in our Expoſition of the 16. Chapter. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Devil beſtoweth on the Beaſt great Authority, which being different from thoſe things that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is to be underſtood of Authority and Dominion over all the World, according to that of the 7. Verſe, where it is ſaid, that <hi>Power</hi> (Greek <hi>Authority,</hi> the ſame Word that is uſed here in the 2. Verſe) <hi>was given him over all kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104168:9"/>and tongues, and nations.</hi> Where by the the way it is to be obſerved, that the Authority of the Beaſt is no lawful Authority, nor Ordinance or God, as being given to him by the Devil; and therefore Men are no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſubmit out of conſcience unto him, than unto the Devil that ſet him up: and accordingly when the Saints levy Arms againſt the Beaſt, and wage war with him, (though with ill ſucceſs, as being vanquiſhed by him in fight,) they do not ſin againſt God, nor break that holy Commandment of his delivered to them by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>It appeareth by this paſſage, that the Beaſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a deadly Wound, (whether in Battel, or by ſome other accident, is uncertain) and that the healing of this Wound ſhall cauſe all the World to admire him.</p>
                  <p>For who would not wonder at ſuch a King as being wounded unto death, is notwithſtanding afterwards cured, ſeeing this cannot be effected but by ſupernatural means? Thus when King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> being ſick unto death, was reſtored to his health, the Cure was not wrought without a Miracle. Neither is there any ſufficient Reaſon can be rendered, why we ſhould depart from the Letter in the Interpretation of this place. But if it be here objected; that the Wound which the Beaſt receiveth in one of his Heads, ſeemeth not to concern him, and therefore neither is the Cure thereof likely to draw all the World into the admiration of him, in as much as the Heads are ſeven other Kings. I anſwer, that though the Heads do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104168:10"/>denote ſeven other Kings, yet this hindereth not but that one of them may in a leſs principal manner ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him alſo.

Nor is this any whit more ſtrange, than that the great Horn between the Eys of the He-Goat, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.5. ſhould ſignifie one and the ſame perſon with the Goat himſelf, as the Angel there ſhews it doth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. namely, <hi>Alexander</hi> the King of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the firſt King thereof, who ſubdued <hi>Darius</hi> the King of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> and ſo was the Goat that trampled on the Ram with two Horns there ſpoken of.</p>

For this being a more than ordinary act of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104168:11"/>Tyranny, requireth the aſſiſtance of the Devil to ſtir up and ſtrengthen the Beaſt to perform it.

Neither is the Blaſphemy of the Beaſt terminated in God and his Tabernacle, but extendeth it ſelf to all thoſe dwelling in Heaven, namely, Chriſt and the holy Angels, which fully verifieth what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of this Beaſt, under the name of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>he ſhall exalt himſelf above every one that is called
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104168:11"/>God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. For this Appellation of God is in the Scripture given both to the Father, and to his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and alſo to the holy Angels.

And this is a thing very remarkable, giving us to underſtand, that the Saints, though fighting in a juſt Cauſe againſt the Beaſt, yet cannot prevail by force of Arms, in as much as the Beaſt is to be defeated by the divine Power of Chriſt their Captain, who will at length appear in the Heaven, riding upon a white Horſe, and by the Sword of his Mouth diſſipate the Beaſt and his Complices.

                  <p>When this ſecond Beaſt is ſaid to have two Horns as a Lamb, this argueth that he maketh a ſhew of Lamb-like meekneſs and innocency in his outward garb, but in his Doctrine hiſſeth like a Dragon, uttering ſuch things as tend to the ruine and deſtruction of Men, as appeareth by the ſequel of this Chapter.</p>

By Mount <hi>Sion</hi> it ſelf is under ſlood <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For though Mount <hi>Sion</hi> (if you ſpeak ſtrictly and properly) was but a Caſtle in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> taken by <hi>David</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign over all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.4,5. yet is it, as being the chiefeſt part of that City, frequently in Scripture put for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf; as <hi>Iſai</hi> 33.29. <hi>Look on</hi> Sion <hi>the City of our ſolemnities: thine eys ſhall ſee</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>a quiet habitation.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.32. <hi>For out of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>ſhall go forth a remnant, and they that eſcape out of Mount</hi> Sion. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 52.1. <hi>Awake, awake, put on thy ſtrength, O</hi> Sion, <hi>put on thy beautiful garments, O</hi> Jeruſalem. Howbeit this ſtanding of Chriſt upon Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104168:16"/>ſo great a company attending him, doth not argue that he ſhall ever reign there by his perſonal preſence, (no more than his ſtanding by <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 23.11. doth evince that he did then reign there after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) but onely intimate that thoſe Saints ſhall perfectly follow the direction of Chriſt, no otherwiſe than if he were perſonally preſent with them in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the fourth Verſe of this Chapter explaineth it, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are they that follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goeth.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by the hundred forty four thouſand, upon whoſe forehead the name of the Lambs Father was imprinted, are meant thoſe Servants of God that were ſealed out of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael, Chap.</hi> 7.4. For both their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and their abode, and the place of their body wherein they are ſealed or marked, exactly agree. Whence by the way it appeareth that the Sealing mentioned in the ſaid ſeventh Chapter ſhall happen in the Age wherein the Beaſt ſhall ariſe, (and conſequently the general converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall precede his coming) otherwiſe thoſe ſealed ones would not thus be inſerted into the Hiſtory of the Beaſt.</p>

                  <p>Whether the voice out of Heaven, reſembling the noiſe of many Waters, and the noiſe of great Thunder, did utter any words, and what thoſe words are, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or hinted, ſo that we muſt of neceſſity remain ignorant thereof: neither is it ſaid, who thoſe Harpers are, onely it is likely they are the Saints in Heaven, who are thus brought in ſpeaking aloud from thence, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.10.

For though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with other Saints to be <hi>redeemed</hi> (or rather <hi>bought,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifieth.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104168:17"/>God, that is, Prophets, for ſo this Appellation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.18. <hi>And to give a Reward to thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets.</hi> And therefore no marvel if theſe perſons being endued with the Spirit of Prophecy, know the new Song that is ſung in Heaven, whileſt other godly perſons in the mean time are ignorant of the ſame. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to be Virgins, and therefore ſuch as have not been defiled with Women. For it evidently follows, that if they be Virgins, and ſo never had to do with Women, they could not poſſibly be defiled with them. Thirdly, to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth that they ſtrayed not from the way wherein Chriſt Jeſus did lead them, but yielded up themſelves to his guidance in all things. Fourthly, to have no Guile in their Mouth, and therefore to be without Fault before the Throne of God: which laſt words, <hi>before the Throne of God,</hi> are emphatical; for it is all one as if it had been ſaid, <hi>before the Judgement-Seat of God;</hi> becauſe (as <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9.7.) the Lord hath prepared his Throne for Judgement.

                  <p>This third Angel ſeemeth to make application of what the firſt Angel ſaid. For if men ought to worſhip God, (as that Angel in his everlaſting meſſage did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare) certainly it is very great impiety to worſhip the Beaſt, who is the profeſſed enemy of God, openly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheming his Name. And leſt any one ſhould imagine it to be a ſmall ſin to worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, or to receive his mark, he denounceth with a loud voice, That <hi>whoſoever doth ſo, ſhall drink of the wine of Gods wrath, that is poured without mixture,</hi> (and ſo not allayed with any thing to abate the force thereof) <hi>into the cup of his anger, and be tormented with fire and brimſtone, before the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104168:20"/>and before the Lamb, and that to all eternity:</hi> for if the ſmoke of their torment ſhall aſcend for ever and ever, (as the Angel plainly affirmeth) it is neceſſary that the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, from whence the ſmoke ariſeth, ſhould alſo continue as long; and if the torment, then alſo the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. So that it ought at no hand to be denyed that the worſhippers of the Beaſt ſhall live for ever in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell fire. Neither is it to be feared leaſt any one ſhould thence argue, that by this account they may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to have <hi>Eternal life.</hi> For <hi>Eternal life</hi> (according to the true and uſual notion of the Scripture) doth not ſignifie a bare living for ever, but a living for ever in joy, and in the favour of God. And therefore <hi>Eternal life,</hi> Matth. 25.46. is oppoſed to <hi>Eternal puniſhment,</hi> when it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> (which implyeth that they remain alive for ever, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how are they capable of being puniſhed for ever? all puniſhment ſuppoſing the exiſtence of the ſubject that is puniſhed:) <hi>But the righteous into life eternal.</hi> And <hi>to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding of Gods wrath upon men,</hi> John 3.36. When it is ſaid, <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life: and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> and <hi>to damnation,</hi> John 5.29. when it is ſaid, <hi>They that have done good, ſhall come forth to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of life: but they that have done evil, unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of damnation.</hi> Theſe things being ſo, ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters are not to be heard, as go about to impoſe a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſenſe upon what is here in the Revelation clearly ſpoken concerning the everlaſting torment prepared for the worſhippers of the Beaſt, for they not onely weaken the force of the Angels commination, (which all muſt needs confeſs to be far more efficacious to deterr men from committing ſo great wickedneſs, if the words be plainly and properly taken) but alſo open a way to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all other paſſages of the Scripture, where mention is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104168:21"/>made of the everlaſting torment of Hell fire. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome one will object, that theſe tormented ones are ſaid <hi>to have no reſt day and night,</hi> and conſequently their torment is to be reſtrained to ſuch a duration, where there is a viciſſitude of day and night, (which ceaſeth together with the world) and ſo is not properly and truly everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To which I anſwer, that this expreſſion of <hi>having no reſt day and night</hi> (inaſmuch as it followeth thoſe words, wherein it is ſaid, that the <hi>ſmoak of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever</hi>) is uſed to ſhew, that they ſhall at no time have any reſpiration from their torment, and not that there ſhall be an end thereof, namely when day and night ſhall ceaſe. For ſeeing all the time of men in this world, is part either of the day, or of the night, that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to paſs in either of them, is not at all: hence it is that the Angel, intending to ſhew that the worſhippers of the Beaſt, ſhall be tormented without intermiſſion, ſaith, that <hi>they have no reſt day and night.</hi> Thus is it ſaid of the four living creatures in Heaven with ſix wings apeice, Chap. 4.8. That <hi>they have no reſt day and night, ſaying, Holy holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,</hi> (though there be no viciſſitude of day and night in Heaven) namely to ſignifie that they never ceaſe at any time whatſoever to praiſe God in that maner. To conclude therefore, As thoſe words, <hi>He ſhall be tormented for ever and ever,</hi> import that there ſhall be no end of their torment, ſo theſe, <hi>They have no reſt day and night,</hi> imply that there ſhall be no intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them.</p>

For this implyeth that he, as being wont to attend at the Altar, did perceive that the Prayers of the Saints, (with which he burned Incenſe before God) were now heard, and that God was accordingly reſolved to avenge his People of their Enemies; wherefore it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from this Paſſage, that there is in Heaven a Temple, and therein an Altar, which <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.3. is ſaid to be of Gold, and to ſtand before the Throne of God, and to have (as here) an Angel for Prieſt to burn Incenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the ſmoke thereof may aſcend up together with the Prayers of the Saints. Neither can it with reaſon be affirmed, that this Angel is Chriſt, not onely becauſe it is very hard, (if not altogether impoſſible) to allege any paſſage of the Scripture, where the appellation of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is undoubtedly given unto Chriſt, but alſo for that this Angel is here plainly differenced from Chriſt; for Chriſt is ſaid to ſit upon a white Cloud, having a ſharp Sickle in his hand, whereas this Angel is ſaid to come out from the Altar, which is in Heaven.

For <hi>John</hi> here ſeeth a great and wonderful Sign of ſeven Angels having ſeven Plagues, which are therefore called the laſt Plagues, becauſe the Anger of God is accompliſhed by them, ſo that after them ſucceedeth the chaining up of Satan, and the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted proſperity of a thouſand years through all the World, as appeareth from the 20. <hi>Chapter.</hi> Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the Angels are here ſent to plague the Beaſt and his Worſhippers, is becauſe all humane means did fail.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the righteouſneſs and truth of his ways, in making theſe Saints according to his promiſe partakers of the firſt reſurrection, becauſe they had for him and his Goſpel hated their lives in this world.

But there not are any that ſubmit to the laws of God given by the hands of Chriſt, and ſo are governed by them, but the Saints, all others being either ignorant of them, or diſobedient to them. Thirdly, It is intimated that it would be altogether unreaſonable for any particular man to refuſe to fear God, and glorifie his name, when there are ſo many notable arguments compelling thereunto, as in the firſt place, the unparallelled holineſs of God.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104168:26"/>man:</hi> And Chap. 9.11.12. <hi>but Chriſt being come, an High Prieſt of future good things, by a greater and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building; Neither by the blood of goats and Calves, but by his own blood he entred in for once</hi> (ſo it is in the Greek) <hi>into the holy place</hi> (or <hi>Sanctuary</hi>) <hi>having obtained everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redemption.</hi> And verſe 24. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places</hi> (or, <hi>Sanctuary</hi>) <hi>made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Which paſſages if we take in the plain and literal ſenſe of them (as the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if well weighed, will inforce us to do) then ſhall we eaſily perceive how aptly the ſame Divine Author, Chap. 8.5. ſpeaking of the Levitical Prieſts, that miniſtred in the Tabernacle, ſaith <hi>Who ſerve unto the example and ſhadow of Heavenly things.</hi> Whereas if we turn aſide to figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive interpretations, neither will that, nor ſundry other places of the Divine Author aforeſaid, be ever rightly underſtood, nor ſhall we be able to render a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why we may not at the ſame rate allegorize upon whatſoever is delivered in the Scripture, whereby it will at length come to paſs, that we ſhall be certain of nothing that is contained therein, being lyable to be carried about with every fanſie, that curious wits can invent, and impoſe upon the letter of the Holy text. Having thus aſſerted the truth, and reality of an Heavenly Tabernacle and Temple, (the conſequence of which Doctrine will further appear, when we come to the 21. &amp; 22. Chap,) we ought to paſs the ſame ſentence upon the Teſtimony that is ſaid to be therein. For if the tabernacle that <hi>Moſes</hi> made, was a type of a greater and more perfect one in Heaven, may not the tables of the Teſtimony alſo which were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein? eſpecially ſeeing that <hi>John</hi> himſelf ſaith in another place of this Prophecie, that <hi>the temple of God was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104168:27"/>opened in heaven, and there was ſeen in his temple the ark of his Teſtament</hi> (or, <hi>covenant.</hi>) Chap. 11.19.</p>

For the fourth Vial being poured out upon the Sun, cauſeth it to ſcorch Men with fire, and that in a very grievous manner.

And let this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104168:31"/>be taken along with us in reading the ſtory of all theſe Plagues, that they are ſo ordered, as that no hurt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth to the righteous from them, God making a way for their eſcape. As we ſee it did happen to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who though dwelling in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were yet untouched with any of the ten Plagues thereof. For albeit their immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be not mentioned till the fourth Plague, which was that of Flyes, concerning which God ſaith, <hi>I will ſever in that day the Land of</hi> Goſhen, <hi>in which my People dwell, that no Swarms of Flies ſhall be there, to the end thou maiſt know that I am the Lord in the midſt of the Earth, Exod.</hi> 8.22. yet reaſon ſheweth that the ſame is to be underſtood in all the foregoing Plagues, for as much as they were ſent of purpoſe to puniſh the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for their cruelty towards Gods people. In like manner though it be not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, that the Sun did not ſcorch the Saints, but onely the wicked, yet muſt it in reaſon be ſuppoſed to have ſo fallen out, and the aforeſaid intimation out of the Text ſheweth as much.</p>

                  <p>As ſome other of the Plagues, that God inflicted upon the Beaſt and his Worſhippers, are the ſame with thoſe that he formerly inflicted upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his People, ſo alſo is this. For the fifth Angel pouring out his Vial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of the Beaſt, (which is without queſtion as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104168:31"/>ſuitable a means to procure darkneſs, as the ſtretching out of <hi>Moſes</hi> hand towards Heaven) his Kingdom, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelf over the face of the whole Earth, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon darkned. The extremity of which Plague is ſuch, that it cauſeth Men to gnaw their Tongues for pain. For conſider how grievous a thing it is, to be bound for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days together in chains of thick and palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (for it would be unreaſonable to think that this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Beaſts Kingdom ſhould be inferiour either in duration or groſneſs to that of <hi>Egypt</hi>) ſo as neither to ſee one another, nor to ariſe out of their places. Howbeit we are not to imagine that the Saints of this time (as well as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> heretofore) during this diſmal Fog, that beſpreads the face of all the Earth, have not light in their dwellings, ſeeing this Plague, together with the reſt, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God for the puniſhment of their Adverſaries, and ſo ought not to involve both alike. And this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently hinted (according to the obſervation on the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the fourth Vial) by the blaſphemies that theſe, Priſoners of darkneſs are ſaid to vent againſt God, the Authour of this and the other Plagues; whereas to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme God is ſo enormous a crime, that it is impoſſible it ſhould be incident to the Saints. Wherefore I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſpeak the People of God, that ſhall be in the Reign of the Beaſt, with the words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap.<hi>60.2.</hi> of his Prophecy, <hi>Behold, the Darkneſs ſhall cover the Earth, and groſs Darkneſs the People; but the Lord ſhall ariſe upon thee; and his glory ſhall be ſeen upon thee.</hi>

Neither is it a new thing that a river ſhould be dryed up to give way to Princes and their hoſts: For we read in the ſcripture that <hi>Jordane</hi> was turned back, to the end <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might in a terrible manner go over without
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104168:32"/>interruption into the land aforeſaid. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 3.17. But as the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> is miraculouſly dryed up by the Angel for the ſpeedier paſſage of the eaſtern Kings, ſo cometh not it to paſs without a miracle that they are drawn to undertake ſo deſperate a deſign, as to fight againſt Chriſt and his Saints, for three unclean ſpirits do, by working miracles, incite not onely the foreſaid Eaſtern Kings, but alſo all the Kings of the world to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this exploit. And for as much as theſe are ſeen to proceed out of the mouth of the Dragon, and of the Beaſt, and of the falſe prophet, this argueth that not onely the Dragon, but alſo the Beaſt, (to whom the Dragon is ſaid to give his throne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.2.) together with the Falſe Prophet, (who is ſaid to exerciſe all the power of the Beaſt before him; <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.11, 12.) have dominion over the evil ſpirits, to ſend them to and fro in the earth. This ſo great an expedition of all the Kings in the world combining to cut off the people of God at a blow, is in it ſelf very apt to ſtrike a terrour into the Saints (were no river dried up to give way to any of the Kings aforeſaid) and ſo to make them flinch from their faith and Piety, wherefore the admonition, here given by Chriſt, is very ſeaſonable, who comparing his coming to that of a thief, becauſe of the ſuddenneſs thereof (for when his Enemies ſhall ſay, Peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction ſhall ſeize upon them) pronounceth them happy, who in ſo perillous a time hold faſt the garments of their righteouſneſs, whereby the nakedneſs of their ſins committed in the time of Ignorance, is kept from appearing to their ſhame.

                  <p>God had already plagued the Beaſt, and his worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the other three Elements, of Earth, Water, and Fire, as appeareth by the hiſtory of the firſt, third, and fourth vials: Wherefore that all nature may be armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo out-ragious offenders, this laſt vial is poured out into the Air. Which is no ſooner done, but a loud voice is heard out of the temple in Heaven, from the Throne, ſaying, <hi>It is done.</hi> This voyce is rightly aſcribed to God himſelf that ſitteth upon the throne, rather then to any other perſon about or under the Throne (as we ſee it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104168:34"/>come to paſs, Chap, 19.5.) becauſe we find him ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the ſame maner, Chap. 21.5, 6. <hi>He that ſat upon the throne, ſaid, Behold, I make all things new. And he ſaid unto me, Write, for theſe words are true and faithful. And he ſaid unto me, It is done.</hi> As therefore in that place it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that there is a period ſet to the duration of the world, ſo doth it here intimate that no more vials of wrath are to be poured out, foraſmuch as the wrath of God is accompliſhed by this laſt. The voyces, thunders, and lightnings that follow hereupon, are all fore-runners of the great and ſore Judgements, that God is about to bring upon the inhabitants of the earth. For thus we ſee the plagues, pertaining to the ſeven trumpets, uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, Chap. 8.5, 6. Among thoſe Judgements, an Earthquake is one, affirmed here to be the greateſt that ever hapned ſince God created man upon the earth; the truth whereof will appear to us, if we conſider the ſeveral effects of this Earthquake. For firſt, it ſundreth Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem into three parts, to wit, by the ſinking of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate buildings into the ground, (for no other diviſion is wont to be the effects of an Earthquake.) And of this Cities ſhaking about this time we have a more ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Chap, 11.13. For that Jeruſalem is here meant by <hi>the great City,</hi> is evident in that it is diſtinguiſhed from great Babylon, and the other Cities of the nations or Gentiles. Wherefore there remaineth no other City to be underſtood, but that of the Jews, Jeruſalem, which hath this very appellation of a great City given to it. Chap. 11.8. Another effect of this unuſual Earthquake is the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Cities of the Heathen, many of which ſeem to be overturned thereby, as it is wont to happen in ſuch ſhakings. A third effect (or at leaſt a conſequent) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the coming of great Babylon into remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to give unto her the cup of his fierce wrath. Not that God had before forgotten her, but becauſe he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104168:34"/>did not then ſo remember her, as to execute his fierce wrath upon her, that buſineſs being reſerved for this time. The maner of which execution you may read at large in the 18. Chapter. The fourth effect is the removal of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Iſland, and the ſinking of the mountains, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ceaſed to appear. Theſe two things ſhall either come to paſs, as they are here related, (for ſo the others that go before are undoubtedly to be fulfilled) or elſe they onely denote the great alteration that ſhall happen over all the world, by the erecting of the fifth Kingdom upon the defeat of the Beaſt, and all the Kings of the earth that ſide with him. For in this ſenſe is the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval underſtood, Chap. 6.14. After this earthquake, and the dire effects thereof cometh another Judgement very terrible, namely, that of Hail, which is wont to be bred in the Air, (the place into which this ſeventh vial is poured) and thereof God himſelf ſaith to Job, <hi>Haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the hail, which I have reſerved againſt the time of trouble, againſt the day of battel and war? Job.</hi> 38.22, 23. Accordingly we read, not onely that this was one of the ten plagues of Egypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.23, 24, 25. but alſo that God did caſt down great Hailſtones from Heaven upon the <hi>Amorites</hi> at the battel of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> ſo that more died with the Hail-ſtones then they whom the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlew with the ſword. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.5, 11. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it is likely that neither the Hail-ſtones of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor thoſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> were equal in bigneſs to them that fall down from Heaven upon the worſhippers of the Beaſt. For they are ſaid to be about a talent apiece. Now though we cannot certainly tell how much a talent weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet are we ſure that the weight thereof was very great, inaſmuch as the branched Candleſtick of the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and all the veſſels thereof are by the appointment of God to be made of one talent of Gold. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.31, 39. But this plague worketh no better effect upon men, then
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104168:35"/>the former ones did. For they are ſo enraged with the greatneſs thereof, that they cannot forbear to vent Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies againſt God himſelf. Which ſheweth that the end of theſe Plagues is not to reform thoſe, on whom they are ſent, (for undoubtedly ſuch as are come to that height of impiety as to worſhip the Beaſt, yea, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon himſelf, are altogether incurable) but onely to puniſh and torment them for their wickedneſs, and ſo to ſet off the Riches of Gods grace towards the Righteous, whom he hath appointed to Salvation.</p>

                  <p>Though the filthineſs of this woman was very great, and her actions abominable above thoſe of all other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet would not God have poured out his wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her in ſo ſignal a maner as is related in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing chapters, had ſhe not above all her other evils, defiled her hands with the blood of Saints and Martyrs; For this is one of thoſe ſins that make the lowdeſt cry in the ears of God, as the Hiſtory of righteous <hi>Abel</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10, 11. But this woman had already ſwallowed, and was before her ruine to ſwallow ſo much of this precious blood, that <hi>John</hi> here already perceiveth her to be drunk therewith, which drunkenneſs of hers might eaſily appear to him, as he looked upon her; but that it was cauſed by quaffing the blood of Saints and Martyrs, the knowledge hereof muſt needs proceed from Revelation: whether of the Angel, (as it is moſt likely) or of ſome other heavenly perſon. And here by the way let the difference between the <hi>Saints</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>witneſſes</hi> of Jeſus be well obſerved. For the <hi>Saints</hi> are meerly pious men, but the <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of Jeſus are ſuch, as, beſides their piety, have alſo the Spirit of Prophecy, and ſo become capeable of bearing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104168:37"/>teſtimony to Jeſus. For if, (as this very Angel aſſerteth, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.10.) <hi>the Teſtimony</hi> or <hi>Witneſſing of Jeſus be the Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> then a <hi>Martyr</hi> or <hi>Witneſs</hi> of Jeſus muſt be ſuch a one as is indued therewith. Howbeit though <hi>John</hi> had received that Spirit, yea underſtood the cauſe of the womans drunkenneſs, yet (as propheſying but in part) he could not for all this tell who the woman her ſelf ſhould be; And therefore (as admiration is wont to proceed from Ignorance) he doth exceedingly wonder at her. In which wondring condition he was likely to have continued, had not the Angel diſcloſed to him the Myſtery of the woman, as he doth alſo that of the Beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns that carried her, which deſcription plainly ſheweth that this Beaſt is the ſame that formerly was ſeen to ariſe out of that Sea, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. And therefore he is, as formerly, ſimply called the Beaſt, whenſoever he is afterwards mentioned. As for his carrying of the woman, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof (as will further appear from what ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be ſpoken) is becauſe the Government of the City, which the woman repreſents, did ſometimes reſt upon him, and ſo he was the ſupport thereof.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104168:38"/>unto <hi>John</hi> the Myſtery of the Beaſt, (whom we ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards finde to be <hi>Domitian</hi>) ſaith of him, that <hi>he was and is not.</hi> Wherby is meant, that <hi>he was ſometimes in power, but now at the time of this Viſion was not ſo.</hi> For that it muſt not be underſtood of his <hi>being alive,</hi> is evident from the cloſe of the <hi>Verſe,</hi> where it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> The meaning of which words then would be, that <hi>he was alive, and is not alive, and yet is alive.</hi> Which every one ſeeth to be a flat contradiction. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the other Interpretation (which is indeed that of the Angel himſelf, as may be ſeen in the 11. <hi>Verſe</hi>) the words carry in themſelves no contradiction, but a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; divine elegancy, amounting to this ſenſe, that <hi>though the Beaſt had formerly been in power, and now was not ſo, yet was he ſtill in being.</hi> But that which exceedeth all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men, and would ſurpaſs their belief alſo, were it not ſo plainly delivered both here and <hi>Chap.</hi> 11 7. is, that <hi>the Beaſt ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit.</hi> Which being ſpoken of one that was then alive, doth imply that he ſhould dy, and afterward ariſe from the Dead, to act thoſe ſtupendious things, that are foretold of him in this Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For that <hi>the bottomleſt Pit</hi> is the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Dead, and ſo to aſcend from thence is to ariſe from the Dead, is evident from that Paſſage of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul, Rom</hi> 10.7. where he ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall deſcend into the deep?</hi> (Greek <hi>Abyſs,</hi> or <hi>bottomleſs Pit,</hi> the ſame word that is uſed in the <hi>Revelation</hi> concerning the Beaſt) <hi>that is to bring up Chriſt from the Dead.</hi> For what relation would the Deſcent into <hi>the deep</hi> or <hi>bottomleſs Pit</hi> have to the bringing up of Chriſt from the Dead, if the Dead had not there their abode? In the next place mention is made of the Beaſts going into perdition, which, being here ſet down as a thing that is to follow his Aſcent out of the bottomleſs Pit, ſhall then be fulfilled, when he is thrown alive into the Lake burning with fire and brimſtone,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104168:38"/>above a thouſand years before the Judgement of the great day, as may be ſeen in the 19. and 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> Which yet new and unuſual puniſhment is to be imputed to the ſtrangeneſs of his offences, afore related in the 13. <hi>Chapter,</hi> which he (as ſhall by and by be proved) will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate after he is riſen from the Dead. Laſt of all, the Angel ſpeaketh of the Admiration, wherein all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth will have the Beaſt, <hi>that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> namely, when they ſhall ſee him after his Reſurrection inveſted with ſo vaſt an Empire, and cured of his deadly Wound, as is expreſſed in the 13. <hi>Chapter.</hi> For that the things, related of the Beaſt in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> are to be performed by him, when he is riſen from the Dead, is evident, in that the very chief of them came not to paſs in the time of his former life, as will appear to any one that peruſeth what hath been written of him by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authours. For where is it ſaid of him in ſtory, that <hi>he received a deadly Wound and recovered?</hi> (Yea, we finde on the contrary, that when he had been wounded by one <hi>Stephanus,</hi> he was ſo far from being cured thereof, that he was by others coming in preſently after killed outright. See <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Domitian, cap.</hi> 17.) Where, that <hi>his Image was erected, and made to ſpeak, that they might be put to death that refuſed to worſhip it?</hi> Where, <hi>that he did ſet a Mark upon either the fore-head or the right hand of Men, without which none might buy or ſell?</hi> Theſe and ſundry other remarkable things, recorded of the Beaſt in the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were never yet acted by him, nor indeed by any other perſon whatſoever (that we read of) ſince this Prophecy was written; wherefore, if the Beaſt, that was long ſince ſlain, muſt do them (as this Prophecy plainly teſtifieth) it will unavoidably follow that he muſt be raiſed from, the Dead to that purpoſe. But though the Inhabitants of the Earth in general ſhall admire the Beaſt, yet ſome will refuſe to do ſo, namely,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104168:39"/>
                     <hi>They whoſe names were written in the book of life from the foundation of the world.</hi> By which paſſage it is clear that there is a certain number of men ordained by name to eternal life from the foundation of the world. And this Ordination is alledged by the Angel as the true cauſe why they above others conſent not to the epidemical impiety, that is committed in admiring the Beaſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever meet with any man, who denying ſuch a particular and peremtory Ordination could give a clear and ſatisfactory anſwer to this paſſage, which in my judgement (now that I have made a more diligent ſearch thereinto) ſeemeth ſufficient to decide the ſo much agitated controverſie about Predeſtination, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you add that other invincible argument, taken from the Ordination of Chriſt himſelf. For if Chriſt were unchangeably Ordained to glory not only <hi>from</hi> but alſo <hi>before</hi> the foundation of the world, (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture atteſteth, and all Chriſtians grant) why ſhould not we by like reaſon affirm the ſame of his people, it being altogether abſurd, to imagine that the head ſhould be deſigned, and not alſo the body pertaining thereunto, inaſmuch as they have a mutual relation the one to the other? For whereas ſome indeavour to decline the dint of the foreſaid paſſage in the Revelation, by referring thoſe words <hi>from the foundation of the world</hi> to the book it ſelf, and not to the writing of the names therein: this can by no means conſiſt, for then to exclude all ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an Article would have been prefixed to them in the Greek, and accordingly the words have run thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Again, I would demand of any man well skilled in that language, how the Angel could ſpeak otherwiſe then he doth, were it his intention (as I affirm) to ſhew that certain mens names were from the foundation of the world written in the book of life. But if he meant to ſignifie that the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104168:39"/>Book onely was from the Foundation of the World, that (as I before ſhewed) might eaſily have been done, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Article, agreeing in <hi>Greek</hi> with the word <hi>Book,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe words, <hi>From the Foundation of the World.</hi>

                  <p>By what the Angel hath here ſpoken to declare the Myſtery of the Beaſt, it is manifeſt that by the Beaſt is meant a Man, who was alive when this Viſion happened to <hi>John:</hi> For the Angel ſaith expreſly <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. that <hi>he is.</hi> It is alſo manifeſt that the Beaſt had already been a King at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhould after the deceaſe of his two immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Predeceſſours reign there again.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104168:41"/>in the time of this Viſion, to whom ſuch a thing doth agree, ſave <hi>Domitian,</hi> about the end of whoſe Empire <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. that this Book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was ſeen? <hi>Neque enim ante multum temporis</hi> (ſo are his words) <hi>viſum eſt, ſed paenè ſub noſtro ſaeculo ad finem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiani imperii.</hi> Which may be ſo far true, as that perhaps it was not publiſhed and commonly known before that time.

And it is likely that the Angel ſo ordered the Viſion, that the computation ſhould begin from <hi>Claudius</hi> incluſively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, that imployed his Authority to moleſt the Christians.

                  <p>Hitherto the Angel hath ſpoken concerning the Beaſt and his ſeven Heads, now he cometh to the ten Horns, that are upon him, which be expreſly telleth us, (as you ſee here) that <hi>they are ten Kings, who did not yet reign, but ſhould receive Authority together with the Beaſt.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs out of what particular parts of the World theſe Kings ſhall ariſe, he doth not ſhew, or intimate. So that we muſt of neceſſity be ignorant of that circumſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the thing it ſelf be accompliſhed, or at leaſt till God be pleaſed to make a Revelation thereof. Onely it appeareth out of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7.24, 25. that they ſhall ſtart up out of the fourth univerſal Kingdom, that is, the <hi>Roman.</hi> For that this Prophecy of the Beaſt and his ten Horns, is the ſame with that of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>Chapter</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:104168:42"/>aforeſaid, will eaſily appear, if you diligently compare both the paſſages together. By ſo doing you will finde, that the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is in <hi>Daniel</hi> called the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn, in as much as the Actions, the Confederates, and the time of their Tyranny are exactly the ſame in both. Howbeit the time is but ſhort, that theſe ten Kings ſhall reign together with the Beaſt, for the Angel ſaith, it ſhall be <hi>one hour:</hi> which Expreſſion of <hi>one hour,</hi> though it be not ſtrictly and properly taken for the twelfth part of a Day, (it being impoſſible for the ten Kings to perform all that is here foretold of them, in the ſpace of ſuch an hour) yet doth it confeſſedly ſignifie a ſhort period of time, as other like paſſages of the Scripture will inform us. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.17. ſaith, <hi>We, Brethren, being taken from you for a ſhort time time,</hi> (Greek <hi>for the time of an hour</hi>) <hi>in preſence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to ſee your face with great deſire.</hi> And <hi>Philemon</hi> 15. <hi>Perhaps he therefore departed for a ſeaſon,</hi> (Greek, <hi>an hour</hi>) <hi>that thou mighteſt receive him for ever,</hi> Now for as much as I have before evinced that the Beaſt doth perſonate <hi>Domitian</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and no ſuch thing as the ſtarting up of ten new Kings, and their Confederacy with him, is ſaid in Hiſtory to have yet happened to him, I judge I may firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undoubtedly conclude, that this muſt hereafter be fulfilled, when he ſhall ariſe from the Dead to rule again. The next thing that the Angel mentioneth, is <hi>the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ten Kings,</hi> not whereby they ſtand well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards one another, but whereby they all give their Power and Authority to the Beaſt, who ſetteth himſelf againſt Gods people. For as to any good correſpondence between them in relation to their particular eſtates, they are ſo far from it, that they can no more cleave together, than Iron be mixed with Clay. Yea, though an union be endeavoured by Alliance, yet can it not be effected, as we are taught by the famous Viſion of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>

                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.43.44. For that theſe Kings mentioned in this ſecond <hi>Chapter</hi> are the ſame with thoſe of the ſeventh is apparent, as from other circumſtances, ſo from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Kingdom, out of which they riſe, and alſo from their very number, in that they are deſigned by ten horns in the one <hi>Chapter,</hi> and by ten toes in the other. Laſtly he ſaith of theſe Kings that <hi>they ſhall make war with the Lamb:</hi> Not that they uſe hoſtility againſt the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, (for he being glorified with his Father in the heavens, is altogether uncapable of having violence offered to him) but becauſe they are armed againſt the Saints, of whom Chriſt is the head, and Captain. Thus <hi>Abijah</hi> the King or <hi>Judah</hi> exhorteh <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from fighting againſt God, when they were about to aſſail his people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God himſelf is with us for our Captain, and his Prieſts with ſounding Trumpets to cry alarm againſt you: O children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>fight ye not againſt the Lord God of your Fathers, for ye ſhall not proſper.</hi> Moreover that the Saints alſo put themſelves in aray againſt thoſe Kings, appeareth, not only from what is plainly affirmed hereof, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.19. (where it is ſaid, <hi>I ſaw the Beaſt and the Kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war with him that ſat on the horſe, and againſt his army</hi>) but may ſufficiently be deduced from that very expreſſion of <hi>making war</hi> (which is here ſimply and without limitation uſed by the Angel) as I have before proved in mine expoſition, on <hi>Chaep.</hi> 13.7. But in vain is hoſtility uſed by thoſe Kings againſt Chriſt, for he being (as the angel further ſaith) a <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> can eaſily ſubdue them, as we ſee it come to paſſ in the foreſaid nineteenth <hi>Chapter.</hi> Again, <hi>they that are with him</hi> (that is, <hi>on his ſide</hi> as this form of ſpeech doth elſewhere ſometimes ſignifie, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 11.23. <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me</hi>) <hi>are called</hi> (to

But theſe words, aſwell as that of <hi>warring,</hi> before uſed, imply that the Saints do muſter and imbody themſelves in an army, namely that they may (when their Captain Chriſt Jeſus hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Beaſt and all the Kings of the earth with the ſword of his mouth) erect the fifth Kingdom according to that of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7.21, 22. <hi>I beheld and the ſame horn,</hi> (that is, <hi>the little horn,</hi> whom I before proved to be the ſame with the Beaſt in the Revelation) <hi>made war with the Saints and prevailed againſt them; until the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of days came, and Judgement was given to the Saints of the moſt high: and the time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdom.</hi>

For they being by the perfection of their nature exempted from death or any other tribulation whatſoever, are thereby alſo incapable of ſharing in the ſalvation of God, and accordingly uſe no ſuch form of praiſing him. Whence it followeth that they be men. Not holy men upon the earth, for they are denoted by the four and twenty elders, and the four living creatures, mentioned afterwards in the fourth verſe of this Chapter, it remaineth therefore that the multitude aforeſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of holy men already raiſed from the dead; and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the Kingdom of heaven, when <hi>Rome</hi> is deſtroyed (and ſo differ from them, who after that deſtruction ſhall be made partakers of the ſame anticipated reſurrection, as may be ſeen in the twentieth Chapter of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) and conſequently are that great multitude of Saints, afore mentioned in the ſeventh Chapter, verſe 9. For that thoſe Saints are ſuch, as being riſen from the dead, triumph in the Kingdom of heaven, is evident from the deſcription there given of them. For it is ſaid that <hi>they were come out of the great tribulation,</hi> ſo it is emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally expreſſed in the Greek, and therefore intimateth that they weee ſet free from death the chiefeſt of all tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations) and alſo <hi>were clothed in white Robes, and ſtood before the throne of God,</hi> being put into ſuch a condition, <hi>that they ſhould no more hunger; nor thirſt, becauſe the Lamb ſhould feed them, and lead them unto living fountains of water.</hi> No one of which things agreeth either to men here living on the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to the ſouls of ſuch as are departed this life. Now the reaſon that inciteth theſe Saints in heaven with loud and redoubled voices to cry, <hi>Allelujah,</hi> that is, <hi>Praiſe the Lord,</hi> (for ſo this word, originally Hebrew, doth ſignifie, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.1.) is the juſtice of God, who (as it is here ſaid) <hi>had both judged that great Harlot, which with the lewdneſs of her
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104168:46"/>whoredome corrupted the earth,</hi> (whereof we have before ſpoken in our expoſition on the ſeventeenth Chapter) <hi>and alſo had avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand.</hi> and this vengeance is taken in ſo ſtrange a maner, that it is not to be parrallelled in all the holy ſcripture, ſave in the prediction concerning the judgement of God againſt <hi>Bozrah</hi> and the land of <hi>Idumea,</hi> whereof we read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and which is not yet come to paſs: for though many Cities have been burned with the fire of men, yea <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah</hi> with the fire of God from heaven, yet hath it not been known that any City, after it was once fired, did ſend up the ſmoak of her burning for ever and ever, as it is here affirmed of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alone doth ſufficiently prove that the prophecy held forth in this book concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not yet fulfilled, foraſmuch as ſhe (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſackings and firings that have ſince hapned to her) is yet ſtanding, and that in great ſtate and ſplendor, ſo far is ſhe from being made a deſolation and perpetual burnings.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104168:48"/>the ſalvation of the righteous (as being in it ſelf a work more excellent and glorious) of far greater efficacy to ſtir up the Saints to the performance of theſe two things. Hence it is that the acclamation here made; is more loud and ſolemn then the others that went before. For <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he heard as it were the voice of a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thundrings ſaying, Alleluja.</hi> The reaſon of which unuſual Exultation (that I may confirm what I even now aſſerted) is in the firſt place ſaid to be <hi>the Reign of God,</hi> namely, upon the Delivery of the Kingdom into the Hands of the Saints. For though God was long before ſaid in the Scripture to be <hi>the King of all the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 47.7. yet in as much as to reign (if you ſpeak properly) is to rule and govern by Laws, the Reign of God over all the World may in this ſenſe be rightly ſaid to commence with the Kingdom of the Saints. And that this Notion of <hi>Reigning</hi> is true, and grounded on the Scripture, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, in that God is then ſaid <hi>never to have born rule over the Heathen, the Adverſaries of his People, Iſai</hi> 63.18, 19. which can be no otherwiſe true, than becauſe he had not preſcribed them Laws. Whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry own God for their King, becauſe he had been their Law-giver, as may be ſeen in thoſe Words of the ſame Prophet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us.</hi> But when upon the Defeat of the Beaſt, (who, as I have ſhewed before, is the ſame with the <hi>little Horn</hi> in the ſeventh of <hi>Daniel</hi>) The Dominion and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall be given to the Saints of the moſt High, the World ſhall be ruled by them according to the Laws of God which he hath given by Chriſt Jeſus, and the Laws of all Nations ſhall for the common good be conformed unto that Standard, whereas now they are for the moſt part ſubſervient to the Luſts and Intereſts of a certain
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104168:48"/>ſort of Men. So that God (to whom the Saints are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient in the Kingdom) will then of right be ſaid to reign more perfectly and truly, than he had ever done ſince the World began.</p>

But whereas it is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104168:50"/>objected, that contrary to the practice of this Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> we finde that other Angels in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> when they ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Servants of God, permitted themſelves to be worſhipped, as the Angel that exhibited himſelf to the view of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> as may be ſeen in the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Hiſtory, <hi>Verſes</hi> 13, 14, 15.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104168:51"/>ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi> But inaſmuch as Chriſt doth here intend to ſhew himſelf as the Captain of his people, he appeareth not, (as he did to <hi>Stephen</hi>) ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the heaven, but riding on a Horſe, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders are wont to do. And this Horſe is ſaid to be white, (a colour much uſed in time of joy and triumph) to denote the ſucceſs and victory of Chriſt over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, according to what we read, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.2. where it is ſaid, <hi>I ſaw, and behold, a white Horſe, and he that ſat on him had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</hi> But the victories and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of Chriſt are not procured by ſuch arts of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and falſhood as Earthly Commanders too often put in ure, little regarding unjuſt the means be, ſo they may attain the end they have propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even the conqueſt of their Enemies. For Chriſt on the contrary is faithful and true, neither making uſe of a wrong ſentence in his Judicature, nor of an unjuſt conflict in his warfare, but in both behaving himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exact rules of righteouſneſs, as will appear by the judgement that he is about to execute upon the Beaſt and his followers at the battel of <hi>Armageddon.</hi> Nor marvel therefore if ſo great uprightneſs be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſuitable glory and power. For the eyes of Chriſt are ſaid to be <hi>like a flame of fire,</hi> and ſo able to ſtrike a terrour in all them that look upon his face, <hi>and on his head are many crowns,</hi> which implieth the greatneſs of his dominion, extending it ſelf over many kingdoms. Yea, for his greater dignity he hath <hi>a name written,</hi> (to wit, upon the crowns, for it is abſurd to imagine it written upon his head, inaſmuch as it is covered with his crowns) <hi>which none knoweth but he himſelf.</hi> Wherefore it would be preſumption in us to uſe any means for the finding out of this name. For beſides the reading after that which cannot be attained, we
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104168:52"/>ſhould thereby diſcover an ambition in us to intrench upon the prerogative of Chriſt, which argueth little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards him. If it be her demanded, how it hapneth that this name ſhould be inſcribed on the crowns encompaſſing the head of Chriſt, and alſo be ſeen of <hi>John,</hi> (as his words imply, in that he is a witneſs of it) and yet neither he, nor any other ſhould attain the knowledge thereof: I anſwer, this cometh to paſs becauſe they cannot read it.

                     </gap>, the word here under debate) among the ſpecies of <hi>diſcrete quantity</hi> which is an accident. But Chriſt by the confeſſion of all is a ſubſtance and no accident. Wherefore he is called <hi>the word</hi> or <hi>ſpeech</hi> of God improperly and figuratively, but if ſo, then there muſt be ſome reſemblance between <hi>the ſpeech</hi> of God properly ſo called, and Chriſt Jeſus, which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104168:52"/>by ſearching the Scripture we ſhall finde to conſiſt in theſe two reſpects: firſt becauſe the ſpeech of God properly ſo taken, doth immediately flow from the divine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: ſo alſo did Chriſt come immediately from the divine Majeſty in heaven to publiſh the Goſpel to the world, and ſo was <hi>the ſpeech,</hi> or <hi>immediate interpreter of God.</hi> This is confirmed by that notable paſſage of <hi>John,</hi> who having in the entrance of the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Goſpel given the appellation of <hi>the word</hi> or <hi>ſpeech</hi> to Chriſt, ſeemeth to explain the ſame in the eighteenth <hi>verſe</hi> thereof, ſaying, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the only begotten Son which is</hi> (or rather, <hi>was</hi>) <hi>in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> Chriſt himſelf alſo ſaith in the ſixth <hi>Chapter</hi> of that Goſpel, <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me,</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.42. <hi>If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth, and came from God.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.27, 28. <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world, again I leave the world and go to the Father.</hi> Secondly, becauſe as the <hi>ſpeech</hi> of God properly ſo named, hath power to effect whatſoever he pleaſeth, (for ſo God himſelf teſtifieth of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10, 11. where he ſaith, <hi>as the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater: So ſhall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth, it ſhall not return unto me void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whither to I ſent it</hi>) In like manner Chriſt had full power to do whatſoever miracles he pleaſed, as he himſelf witneſſeth, <hi>John</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. where he ſaith, <hi>The Son can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do, for what things ſoever he doth, theſe alſo doth the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104168:53"/>Son likewiſe. For the Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things that he himſelf doth: and he will ſhew him greater works then theſe, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickneth them, even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi> Theſe things being ſo, Chriſt can eaſily diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate all his enemies, as the event will ſhew in the cloſe of this 19. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> You ſee then how aptly <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that the name of Chriſt is called <hi>the word</hi> or <hi>ſpeech of God,</hi> when he is brought in as a Captain ready to encounter with the Beaſt and his complices. For this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth that he can do what mighty works he pleaſeth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Angels, (for they are elſewhere in the Scripture meant by <hi>the heavenly Armies</hi> or <hi>Hoſts,</hi> as appeareth from the words of the Prophet <hi>Micajah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.29. <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon his Throne, and all the Hoſt of heaven ſtanding by him, on his right hand and on his left.</hi> And alſo from the words of Luke, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. <hi>And ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly there was with the Angel a multitude</hi> (not <gap reason="foreign">

And it came to paſs as the Angels were gon away from them into heaven,</hi> &amp;c.) the Angels, I ſay, that here follow Chriſt, though they alſo ride upon horſes, becauſe they are Armies, and their equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page ought to be ſome waies anſwerable to that of Chriſt their Captain, are yet clothed only in fine linen, white and clean, (their uſual Prieſtly weeds, as I have before proved in the expoſition of the fifteenth <hi>Chapter</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt intendeth not at this time to make uſe of their miniſtery, in ſhedding the blood of his enemies, but to do it by himſelf, as appeareth from the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> Whereas Chriſt on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hath not only <hi>a bloody veſture,</hi> but alſo <hi>a ſharp ſword,</hi> not indeed hanging by his ſide, nor held in his hand, but (as it befitteth <hi>the word</hi> or <hi>ſpeech</hi> of God) coming out
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104168:53"/>of his mouth, wherewith he may ſmite the Nations, and ſlay them. The accompliſhment whereof may be ſeen in the ſequel of this <hi>Chapter</hi> Neither is this diſagreeable to what we read elſewhere in the Scripture. For if <hi>Moſes</hi> could with the rod in his hand do miracles, and plague the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> See <hi>Exod;</hi> 4.17. why may not Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel ſmite the Nations with the ſword of his mouth? For as the rod did not contain in it ſelf the power whereby the miracles were wrought, but was only a ſign thereof: ſo neither doth the ſword, which nevertheleſs is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as apt to ſignifie the divine efficacy of Chriſt, who by meerly ſpeaking the word will ſlay ſo many Nations aſſembled together to fight againſt him and his people. But there is not yet an end of deſcribing the warlike power of Chriſt, for there remain three other particu ars belonging thereunto. The firſt whereof is <hi>the ruling of the Nations with a rod of Iron.</hi> Which though it may (with congruity to the tenor of the Scripture) be taken only for the <hi>irreſiſtible power</hi> of Chriſt, whereby he is able to cruſh all his Enemies, yet ſeeing we ought not to depart from the letter of the Scripture, when it yieldeth a fair and commodious conſtruction, I propoſe it to the wiſe and learned to judge, whether it may not with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be thought, that the Saints (into whoſe hands Chriſt will at length miraculouſly deliver all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world, and ſo rule over the Nations by them as ſubordinate to himſelf) ſhall both in their judicature, and warfare (the latter of which is likely to continue till that generation be extinct) uſe ſuch an inſtrument as an Iron rod, to break implacable enemies and capital offenders in pieces. Neither is this ſence contrary to the other, but doth include the ſame, ſhewing how that <hi>irreſiſtible power</hi> of Chriſt ſhall at length put forth it ſelf. The ſecond point is <hi>the treading of the wine-preſs of the wrath of God Almighty,</hi> which I cannot ſufficiently
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104168:54"/>wonder to ſee how it is ſo often applied to the ſufferings that Chriſt himſelf did undergo, when the Text ſpeaketh of the time preſent, ſaying, <hi>he treadeth the winepreſs,</hi> and not of the time paſt: But Chriſt by the confeſſion of all is now exempted for ever from any further ſufferings. Again, when any one treadeth a winepreſs, he himſelf doth not thereby ſuffer any thing, nor is bruiſed, but maketh the grapes to ſuffer bruiſing. And therefore if Chriſt tread the winepreſs of Gods wrath, he himſelf muſt not be conſidered as enduring the wrath of God, but as inflicting it upon others. And indeed the words of the prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap</hi> 63. to which this paſſage ſeemeth to allude, do plainly evince this interpretation of mine to be true and genuine. For he that is there ſeen coming from <hi>Edom,</hi> Red in his apparel, and like to one that treadeth in the winefat, ſheweth the reaſon of this ſtrange attire, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. ſaying, <hi>I have trodden the winepreſs alone, and of the people there was none with me: For I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my garments, and I will ſtain all my raiment.</hi> Doth not this demonſtrate beyond all gainſaying, that to tread the winepreſs of Gods wrath, is to execute his judgements upon others, and not to feel the ſame himſelf? The third thing is the name, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> that is written both on the veſture, and alſo on the thigh of Chriſt, which likewiſe apparently belongeth to the warlike power of Chriſt, becauſe he that is a King is wont alſo to command the ſword for the defence of his people, and the deſtruction of his Enemies, whence it was before, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 14.17.) rendred as the reaſon, why Chriſt ſhould vanquiſh the ten Kings confederate with the Beaſt, (who together with all the reſt of the Kings in the world do here make war againſt Chriſt) namely becauſe he was <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> For this implieth that Chriſt hath dominion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104168:54"/>over all the Kings in the world, and ſo is ſtronger then they, and therefore no wonder if he doth ſubdue and cruſh them. Thus <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 2.37. is called <hi>a King of Kings,</hi> becauſe God had given into his hand all the Earth, and the Kings thereof. Thus alſo <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes, Ezra</hi> 7.12. is ſtiled <hi>a King of Kings,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the gracious Commiſſion he granteth to <hi>Ezra,</hi> becauſe he had now gotten into his hands the Kingdom, whereof <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was ſometime ſeized.</p>

                  <p>We are now at length arrived at that battel, for which ſo much preparation hath been made, &amp; which is the greateſt that ever was ſtruck ſince the world began, putting a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod both to the Tyranny of the Beaſt, (the foreſt enemy of all righteouſneſs that ever was raiſed up) and alſo to the ſufferings of the Saints. The place where it is fought is here indeed omitted, but was in the ſixteenth <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſaid to be called in Hebrew <hi>Armageddon,</hi> which I in the Expoſition of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> have accordingly proved to belong to the Countrey of the Hebrews. The perſons that ſhall fight it are here ſaid to be <hi>the Beaſt and the Kings of the earth with their Armies,</hi> on the one ſide: and <hi>he that ſitteth upon the horſe with his Army,</hi> on the other ſide. Which laſt clauſe clearly ſheweth that there ſhall be an Army in the field ſiding with Chriſt, and having him for their Captain, againſt which the Kings of the earth do directly bend their force, as being capable of hurt. For it is inconceiveable that all the kings of the earth ſhould draw their Armies together into the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to fight againſt the perſon of Chriſt in heaven, which ſhould it deſcend from thence, (as nevertheleſs it ſhall not do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the day of the univerſal judgement) would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impaſſible. Neither can it be ſaid that this Army of Chriſt conſiſteth of Angels, for (to omit the difficulty even now mentioned, and which hath place in Angels as well as in Chriſt) the Angels are ranged in ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as the fourteenth <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> ſignifieth, whereas the Army of Chriſt here mentioned is but one. Again, the Angels are in the place aforeſaid called <hi>the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in heaven that followed Chriſt.</hi> But his implieth that there is ſome other Army of his upon the earth, even that whereof I now diſpute, and which muſt needs conſiſt of the Saints, as was alſo before hinted, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.14. The Iſſue of the Battel is here ſet down in this manner, namely, <hi>that the Kings and their Armies are all ſlain with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104168:56"/>the Sword of Chriſts mouth; but the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are taken, and thrown alive into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> All which is ſo plain, that it needeth no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. Onely let it by the way be obſerved that from hence it undeniably followeth, that the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, are two particular Men, otherwiſe how ſhould they be preſent at the Battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> and there be taken and thrown alive into Hell fire? Certainly, this doth intimate that they are Men, who might as well have been ſlain as others, but were not, becauſe (as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evinced) they had been once dead already, and were reſtored again to life to act the things in this Book related of them. Which if any one ſhould chance to ſcrupleat, as a thing very uncouth, (although it be altogether unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo to do, for as much as I have before out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture demonſtrated the ſame) let him on the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider with himſelf, how ſuitable it is that they whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are prodigiouſly wicked, and ſuch as were never pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the World before, ſhould likewiſe in an unuſual way be raiſed up to perform them.

                  <p>SAtan, that old Serpent, (ſo called and here repreſented, becauſe of his ſubtilty, for the Serpent is in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture noted to be the wiſeſt of all the Beaſts that God created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1.) had now for many thouſand Years abuſed the World at his pleaſure, and of late knowing his time to be ſhort, had vented more than ordinary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the Saints, in ſtirring up the Beaſt to perſecute and kill many of them. Yea, in concluſion he had with his wiles ſo inveigled the Kings of the Earth that at his inſtigation they attempted with joint Forces to cut off the remainder of the Saints from being a People. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the like miſchief in the future, and to the end that the Saints may enjoy a long Tranquillity after ſo hot a Perſecution, an Angel here deſcendeth from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and with the Chain that is in his Hand bindeth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104168:57"/>for a thouſand Years, that he may no more deceive the Nations till the ſaid term be expired. At which time though he be again let looſe to ſeduce and inſtigate the Nations againſt the Saints, yet ſhall that ſeduction conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue but a little while, as the ſequel of this <hi>Chapter</hi> doth declare. Certainly, the binding of Satan muſt needs cauſe ſo happy a revolution over all the World, that we may rather gueſs at it than comprehend it. For conſider how peaceable and glorious the Times muſt needs prove, when Satan the great Incendiary of all thoſe Diſſentions, Outrages, and Cruelties, wherewith the World is ſo much infeſted, ſhall be kept in Priſon for a thouſand Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Men (after the Extinction of that Generation, in whom Satan had ſown the Seeds of Diſcord) ſhall have no other inward Incentive to ſin, than the Diſpoſition of their own Heart, which though it be naturally evil from their youth, yet may it, being alone, more eaſily be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor will without the concurrence of Satan produce ſo grievous Diſorders as now it doth. This therefore is the time when that ſhall truly be fulfilled, which God ſo long ago foretold by the Prophet <hi>Micah, Chap.</hi> 4.3, 4. where he ſaith of the Nations, that <hi>they ſhall beat their Swords into Plough-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks: Nation ſhall not riſe againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more. But they ſhall ſit every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of Hoſts hath ſpoken it.</hi> But the World now is and hath hither to been ſo far from enjoying ſuch felicity, that I cannot ſufficiently wonder, how any man, who is neither a ſtranger to the Records of Antiquity, nor to the condition of the preſent times, ſhould ever imagine that Satan hath already been bound, (namely, in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great) and ſo withheld from deceiving the Nations. For it is apparent that ſince the ſaid Emperour ruled, as notorious Impoſtures have been ſet on foot to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104168:57"/>delude and blinde the World, as are reported to have been hatched in any former Ages. Which Impoſtures we muſt either confeſs to have proceeded from Satan, (and conſequently that he hath not yet been bound) or moſt abſurdly hold, that Men may be as ſhamefully gulled, when Satan hath ceaſed to ſeduce them, as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo that his labor in this kinde hath hitherto been ſuperfluous. Nor need I any difficult reaſoning to prove what I even now aſſerted. For, to omit others, the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> will afford us very evident Inſtances thereof. By the cunning of which two prevailing Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Light of the Goſpel was for many Ages together ſince the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> almoſt extinguiſhed, but that now in latter times God taking pity on the miſerable condition of his Church, hath raiſed up ſundry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who have detected many of thoſe Errours, wherewith the Truth had before been obſcured, and ſo given a good Eſſay to the reſtoring of our holy Faith to its primitive luſtre.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why Satan is caſt by the Angel into the bottomleſs Pit, rather than into another place, is becauſe many of the evil Spirits have ever ſince their Fall lain there bound in Chains of Darkneſs, as both the words of <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4. (where it is ſaid, <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) And alſo of <hi>Jude, Verſe</hi> 6. (where it is ſaid, <hi>The Angels which kept not their firſt Eſtate, but left their own Habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting Chains under Darkneſs, unto the Judgement of the great Day</hi>) do perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly intimate. And therefore certain of them, who were permitted to range up and down the Earth, for the executing of Gods Judgements, having entred into a Man of <hi>Gadara,</hi> and being commanded by Chriſt to come out of him, beſought Chriſt that he would not ſend him into
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104168:58"/>the <hi>bottomleſs Pit,</hi> (for ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>That Thrones are the Seats of Kings is evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but who they are that ſhall ſit upon the Thrones here mentioned, and have Judgement given into their hands, is neither of it ſelf evident, nor here expreſſed, ſo that we ſhould be at a great loſs to finde it out, were it not that <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſpeaking of this matter, (as I have before in the Expoſition of the 17. <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Prophecy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced) ſaith, that <hi>Judgement was given to the Saints of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104168:58"/>moſt High, Chap.</hi> 7.22. It is the Saints therefore that are inveſted with the Right of Judicature, and placed on the Thrones after the Defeat of the Beaſt, and the Binding of Satan. Neither ought this Kingdom to be expected, till theſe two miraculous Events have made way for it. Wherefore as they are exceedingly miſtaken, and fear not to gainſay the plain Words of the Scripture, who hold that there ſhall be no fifth Kingdom, or Kingdom of the Saints here on Earth, when in the mean time an Angel expreſly telleth <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7.27. that <hi>the Kingdom, and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt High:</hi> So are they no leſs out of the way, who dream of any humane Force to be uſed in the Erection of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For this would be to transform the People of the Saints into a Company of Thieves and Robbers. But as the riſe and fall of the Beaſt, the binding of Satan, and ſetting up of the Kingdom of the Saints here on Earth, are great and marvellous Works falling out in the Age here ſpoken of: ſo alſo is the firſt Reſurrection whereof all they ſhall be Partakers, (and ſo reign with Chriſt in heaven) who being either Prophets, (for none but ſuch have the Teſtimony of Jeſus) or meer Saints, do ſuffer Death for refuſing to worſhip the Beaſt. For <hi>John</hi> plainly teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that onely ſuch are raiſed up from the Dead to reign with Chriſt the thouſand Years, as were for their Piety in the Reign of the Beaſt, <hi>beheaded,</hi> or <hi>ſmitten with the Ax,</hi> (as the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifieth.) Which Expreſſion doth either intimate that the Beaſt ſhall both in Judicature (as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> his Anceſtors were wont to do) &amp; alſo in War make uſe of ſuch a Weapon as an Ax to kill the Saints, (as we find in the Scripture that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did to ſlay the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Jer.</hi> 40.22. where it is ſaid, <hi>The voice thereof,</hi> (that is, of <hi>Egypt</hi>) <hi>ſhall go like a Serpent, for they ſhall march with an Army, and come againſt her with Axes, as Hewers of Wood</hi>)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104168:59"/>or elſe under the moſt frequent and noted kinde of ſlaughter, that ſhall be in uſe at that time, all other ways of inflicting Death upon the Saints are comprehended. For what reaſon can be imagined, why thoſe Saints that are put to Death with the Ax ſhould ſhare in the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, rather than ſuch as are diſpatched with ſome other Inſtrument of cruelty? But leſt any one ſhould think this Doctrine of the firſt Reſurrection, taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Letter of the holy Text, to be ſtrange, (though to me it ſeemeth more ſtrange that Chriſtians ſhould ſcruple at a thing ſo plainly and punctually ſet down in the Scripture, for they may as well call into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whatſoever is here ſpoken concerning the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that is to be afterwards at the laſt Day, and to which this Reſurrection is oppoſed,) go to, let us confirm this precious Truth, ſo much encouraging Chriſtians to lay down their Lives for the Goſpel, by other paſſages ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated Reſurrection is held forth, as belonging both to thoſe Saints that ſuffer Death under the Reign of the Beaſt, and alſo to thoſe that dy for Chriſt and the Goſpel at any time whatſoever. Firſt, therefore it is in the 11. <hi>Chapter</hi> ſaid of the two Witneſſes, (who are expreſly there called Prophets, and ſo muſt needs be two Men, ſince none but Men are in the Scripture termed Prophets) that after they had been ſlain by the Beaſt, and their dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes lyen unburied three Days and an half in the Streets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (for not <hi>Rome</hi> but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the great City where Chriſt was ſlain) <hi>The Spirit of Life from God entred into them, and they ſtood upon their feet.</hi> From which words it is undeniably manifeſt that the two Witneſſes are raiſed from the Dead whileſt the Beaſt reigneth. What hinders then, but that the other Prophets and Saints put to Death by him, may likewiſe be reſtored to Life preſently after his Defeat, as this 20. <hi>Chapter</hi> doth in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104168:59"/>the plain and obvious ſence thereof clearly teſtifie? Again, we have in the Expoſition of the nineteenth <hi>Chapter, verſe</hi> 1. proved that there is a great multitude of Saints, even before the deſtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> recalled to life, and triumphing in the kingdom of heaven. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it appeareth from that notable paſſage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.26.27. (where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, (and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron, as the veſſels of a potter ſhall they be broken to ſhivers) even as I have received of my Father)</hi> that whoſoever performeth the duty of a Chriſtian to the end of his life, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth a violent death for the name of Chriſt (for I have elſewhere collected that the notion of <hi>overcoming,</hi> when applied to the Saints in the <hi>Revelation</hi> doth intimate ſuch a death) ſhall be raiſed up from the dead before the day of judgement, to reign over the Nations. For can there any ſuch reign be expected, after that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is once paſt? or did not Chriſt, to whom theſe Saints are in this reſpect to be made conformable, ſo come to reign over the Nations? Neither doth that paſſage of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, ſhould have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Nor that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive, but every man in his own order. Chriſt the firſt fruits, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they that are Chriſts, at his coming.</hi> Theſe paſſages, I ſay, do not a whit withſtand the doctrine of an antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated reſurrection, which we endeavor to evince out of the book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For Chriſt ſpeaketh of men, only as believing on him, and <hi>Paul,</hi> of them as dying <hi>in</hi> the faith, and not <hi>for</hi> the ſame, as the forecited places of the <hi>Revelation</hi> plainly do. Moreover, that the Lord Chriſt Jeſus doth now in very deed reign in heaven, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104168:60"/>ſo hath done ever ſince he ſat down at the right hand of God, (and conſequently the Saints who are partakers of the firſt reſurrection, ſhall there reign with him) is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from that notable paſſage or <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>According to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principalities and powers, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi> And from that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>The like figure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us (not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God) by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt who is gon into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers, being made ſubject unto him.</hi> And alſo from thoſe of <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.14. In the former of which he ſaith, <hi>and from Jeſus Chriſt, the faithful witneſs, the firſt begotten from the dead, and the Prince</hi> (or <hi>Ruler,</hi>) <hi>of the Kings of the earth.</hi> And in the latter, <hi>Theſe ſhall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>he ſhall be King of Kings.</hi> But what need have I to accumulate texts of Scripture for the proof of this matter, when the ſecond and third <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> are of themſelves abundantly ſufficient to convince all that are not obſtinately bent againſt the truth, that Chriſt doth now in his own perſon govern the Church, and take care of it; for you ſhall there have clear and undeniable arguments, both of the cogniſance that he taketh of mens actions, and of the protection he affordeth unto ſuch as walk uprightly with him, and alſo of the judgements he executeth on them that either turn aſide out of the right way, or at leaſt ſlacken their firſt love? ſo that I am
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104168:60"/>not a little moved, when I perceive many, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeem to own the Goſpel, ſo eaſily giving ear to ſuch a doctrine, as aſſerteth that Chriſt is not yet in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and exerciſe of his kingdom, but ſhall hereafter reign, and that upon the Earth: which opinion thwarteth the whole tenor of the New Teſtament (where Chriſt ſince his aſcenſion is uſually called Lord) and annulleth the faith we repoſe in Chriſt, (for to what purpoſe is it to rely on him for help and aſſiſtance, if he be not yet in his kingdome?) and reſtraineth prayer and worſhip before him, and in a word uſhereth in Judaiſm, for there at length this pernicious conceit is wont to center. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing I have irrefragably proved, that Jeſus Chriſt doth now reign in heaven, neither is there ſo much as one paſſage in all the Scripture, that ſaith he ſhall ever reign upon the earth, but he himſelf on the contrary plainly teſtifieth, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. <hi>That his kingdom is not of this world,</hi> (which could not be true, were he to reign perſonally on the earth, as worldly Kings are wont to do) I conclude that whatſoever Saints are raiſed up from the dead to reign with Chriſt during the ſpace of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, before the laſt judgement, muſt of neceſſity aſcend up into heaven where he is. And this is plainly taught us in that forequoted inſtance of the twowitneſſes, who being recalled to life, go up into heaven in a cloud. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.12. Tis true indeed, that the Saints, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the fifth <hi>Chapter, verſe</hi> 10. ſay, <hi>That they were made Kings and Prieſts to their God, and ſhould reign on the earth.</hi> But here is no hint of any reſurrection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Saints are to be underſtood, as having not yet been dead, did and ſhould reign upon the earth. Thus <hi>John</hi> ſaith both of himſelf, and the Saints in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>That Chriſt had made them Kings and Prieſts to God.</hi> And conſequently it might have been truly affirmed of them, <hi>that they ſhould reign upon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104168:61"/>the earth,</hi> where they were already Kings. For whereas it is uſually objected, that thoſe Saints in the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi> ſay of themſelves, <hi>we ſhall reign upon the earth,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not already reign, this is frivolous: for inaſmuch as they were already Kings, (as they themſelves affirm) and ſome of them ſat with their crowns upon their heads, it muſt needs be that they did already reign, and ſo thoſe words <hi>we ſhall reign upon the earth,</hi> do not intimate the beginning, but the continuance of their reign. Thus <hi>John</hi> writeth to certain Chriſtians of his time, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5.13. <hi>To the end that they ſhould believe on the name of the Son of God,</hi> which doth not argue that they did not yet believe, (the contrary whereof is in the beginning of that <hi>verſe</hi> affirmed) but that <hi>John</hi> would have them to perſiſt in the belief of Chriſt. It is alſo ſaid in the 22, <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Prophecy, <hi>verſe</hi> the 3. that the Throne of God <hi>ſhall be</hi> in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> when neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the miniſtery of Chriſt in the heavenly Tabernacle (which I have before proved to be the ſame with the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>) as he ſitteth at the right hand of the Throne of God, doth undeniably ſhew that the Throne of God is already in that City, and conſequently that the aforeſaid paſſage doth onely imply the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it there. Thus have I aſſerted the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>firſt reſurrection,</hi> and ſhown that the Saints who are raiſed from the dead, after the binding of Satan, do reign with Chriſt in heaven a thouſand years. From whence it doth neceſſarily follow that they have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the things in the world, as Chriſt hath, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how could they be partakers with him in ordering and diſpoſing them? But as they are Kings, ſo alſo Prieſts of God and Chriſt, and accordingly do ſerve them both in heaven, what by giving honour and glory to them, what by interceding with them for the Saints who are in the mean time reigning on the earth, For ſo the pattern of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104168:61"/>Chriſt the high prieſt who doth himſelf appear before the face of God, and make interceſſion for the Saints, ſeemeth to require. Nor need we to fear leaſt the Papiſts ſhould take any advantage from this doctrine to palliate their ſuperſtitious conceits about the Saints; for I do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Saints who are dead, and as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> teſtifieth, are <hi>ignorant of us, Chap.</hi> 63.16. and as <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.5, 6. averreth, <hi>know not any thing, nor have any more a portion for ever in that which is done under the Sun,</hi> do pray for them that are here abiding on the earth, but only ſuch Saints as are raiſed from the dead, and tranſlated into heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming there not only kings, but alſo Prieſts of God and Chriſt. No marvel therefore if theſe perſons, who thus riſe a thouſand Years before the reſt of the Dead, are here pronounced both <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy; holy</hi> for that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs it would have been impoſſible for them to have ſeen God, much leſs to appear before his face for others: and <hi>happy,</hi> becauſe all of them are endued with eternal Life, whereas many of them that are raiſed after the thouſand Years are expired, are under the Power of the ſecond Death, as the ſequel of this <hi>Chapter</hi> will ſhew. I may add as a further acceſſion to their happineſs, that they have the Privilege of Reigning with Chriſt over the Nations, whereas they that are not raiſed up till the laſt Day, thereby become incapable of ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for as much as Chriſt ſhall then put down all Rule, and all Authority, and Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24.</p>

                  <p>No ſooner is Satan looſed out of Priſon, upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the thouſand Years, but that profound Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, wherein the World had ſo long been huſht, is preſently diſturbed, and Men again embroiled in new Troubles and Commotions. For Satan by his cunning Suggeſtions inciteth the Nations abiding in the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the World, and here compriſed under the name of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to levy a great and terrible War. Of which Expedition there are two <hi>Chapters</hi> in the Book of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> (namely, the 38. and 39.) that do diſcourſe at large, ſo as that what is wanting in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to the full deſcription thereof, may from thence be ſupplyed. It appeareth therefore from the Relation of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that <hi>Gog</hi> (of which name we finde alſo a certain <hi>Reubenite</hi> to have ſometimes been, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.4.) is a Prince that ſhall be in thoſe Times, when Satan is looſed out of his Priſon, and who ſhall iſſue out of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts, bringing with him an innumerable Multitude of armed Men into the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in hope of a great Booty, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by reaſon of their former long proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity being grown exceeding wealthy, and dwelling ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Walls, Bars, or Gates; and having paſſed through the reſt of the Countrey, they at length ſit down before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which is therefore ſtyled <hi>the beloved Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> becauſe the City of the great King, and more dear to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104168:62"/>him than all the dwellings of <hi>Jacob</hi>) &amp; ſo encompaſs both her and the Army of the Saints there encamped. But as it happened formerly at the Battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> that the Saints when ſet in aray againſt the Enemies, had no need to fight, it being their ſtrength to ſit ſtill, and wait for the Salvation of the Lord, ſo fareth it with them here; for after a great Earthquake, which is wont to be a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of ſuch miraculous Defeats, See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.15. God cauſeth the Enemies to ſmite one another, and not only ſo, but alſo raineth Fire and Brimſtone upon them out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and devoureth them. The greatneſs of which Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Army doth appear by two notable effects that enſue upon the deſtruction thereof. For the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſeven Moneths burying them, and ſeven Years burning up the Weapons wherewith they were armed, ſo that they have no need to take any Fewel either out of the Wood or out of the Field during that time. But who did ever hear or read that ſo prodigious an Invaſion hath been made by the Northern Nations upon the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or indeed by any Nation upon any Land whatſoever, ſince the Book of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was written, to this very day? wherefore the accompliſhment of this Prophecy touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is yet to be expected, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently when it is ſaid in the beginning of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that <hi>the time is at hand,</hi> we muſt not thereupon conclude that whatſoever is related afterwards in that Book, was ſhortly to be performed, (for this very <hi>Chapter</hi> of it, whereon we now comment, containeth the Hiſtory of above a thouſand Years) but onely that they ſhould ere long begin to be fulfilled, as will eaſily appear to him that rightly apprehends what the opening of the Seals, that are mentioned in the ſixth <hi>Chapter,</hi> doth intimate.</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are once deſtroyed, Satan who had deceived and incited them to make ſo terrible a War upon the Saints without juſt cauſe, is for his labour caſt (not into the bottomleſs Pit to be there detained for a certain time) but into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, to be there tormented for ever and ever. From whence it may be gathered, 1. That Satan after this time ſhall not tempt the Sons of Men any more, and conſequently (as we have before diſcourſed,) they ſhall have no other inward ſollicitation to ſin, then what iſſueth from the natural pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their own hearts, which is nothing in compariſon of that malignity, which is infuſed into them by the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Satan. 2. That the reaſon why the Beaſt was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly thrown into Hell-fire, and not Satan alſo, that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him up, is this, becauſe God intended to make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe of the Beaſt, whereas Satan was a thouſand Years after to ſeduce <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> Which being done, and ſo the wrathfull Miniſtery of Satan accompliſhed, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is flung into Hell-fire to be there for ever tormented together with the Beaſt. 3. That Hell-fire (for that is the ſame with the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone) is already in being, and not to be created at the Day of Judgement, otherwiſe how ſhould Satan be thrown thereinto before the coming of that Day? 4. That Satan though a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet is not therefore immaterial, otherwiſe how ſhould a true, real, and material fire as that of the Lake is (ſeeing the ſmoke of men therein tormented is ſaid to aſcend for ever and ever, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.11.) be capable of working on
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104168:63"/>him? For he is no leſs ſaid to be tormented therein, than the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, who being both Men (as I before proved) muſt needs conſiſt of matter, as all will grant.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104168:64"/>the ſupreme Judge, is ſaid to ſit upon <hi>a great white Throne.</hi> By which words the colour of his Throne, which had been hitherto concealed, ſeemeth to be here made known unto us. For ſeeing God, as <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Throne in the Heavens for Judgement, Pſalm</hi> 9.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 103.19. and whiteneſs therein doth, for its purity and luſtre, as well comport with the glory of God, if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than any other colour, why ſhould we not believe that the Throne of Judgement whereon God ſitteth in the Heavens, is (as it is here deſcribed) white? But as the glory of God is ſet out in ſome meaſure by the greatneſs and colour of his Throne; ſo is it infinitely more by the action that is here aſcribed to him, namely the <hi>Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the heaven and earth. For to make them ſo fly away from before his face, as that there is no more place found for them, is indeed to reduce them into nothing. Otherwiſe had they any being, they would alſo have a place, and be ſomewhere. This reduction of the world into nothing leadeth us to believe the more eaſily that it was at firſt created out of nothing. For had the matter thereof been from all eternity coexiſting with God, it would like him be <hi>ens neceſſarium,</hi> and ſo likewiſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity continue for ever with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> having ſeen the ſovereign judge ſitting on his throne, doth in the next place ſee them alſo that ſtand before him in judgement, and they are the dead of all ſorts, whether they be of high or low degree. For that this expreſſion <hi>of great and ſmall</hi> doth ſo ſignifie, is evident from <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> 1.17. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith to the Judges of Iſrael, <hi>Ye ſhall not reſpect perſons, but ye ſhall hear the ſmall as well as the great.</hi> And alſo from the nineteenth <hi>Chapter</hi> of this book, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. Where an Angel inviteth all the fowls of the heaven to come, <hi>that they may eat the fleſh of all men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great.</hi> For the trial of the perſons aforeſaid, are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104168:64"/>opened certain books, containing not their actions, (for the words import the contrary) but the laws by which God proceedeth in judging them, and conſequently they are the books of the Old and New Teſtament. For <hi>Paul</hi> plainly telleth us, <hi>that as many as have ſinned in</hi> (or <hi>under</hi>) <hi>the law, ſhall be judged by the law, Rom.</hi> 2.12. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him, the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be the books, and out of the things written in them, the dead ſhall be judged according to their works. For the inſpection of theſe books doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcover both of what kind the works themſelves are, and what reward is appointed to them. From whence it may be collected, that they to whom God never made known his will, nor imparted any of thoſe laws recorded in the Old and New Teſtament, but ſuffered them to walk in their own waies, albeit they ſhall periſh for their wickedneſs, yet ſhall they not undergo any trial. And thus much are we taught by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that knew not God.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. <hi>As many as have ſinned without law, ſhall alſo periſh without law,</hi> That is, without having any law propoſed, whereby they ſhould be tried and caſt. Moreover that we might have a more full knowledge of the foreſaid judgement, both the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, which is a preparative thereunto, and alſo the ſeveral places from whence the dead come forth are here deſcribed. For the <hi>Sea</hi> giveth up the bodies of them that were drowned therein, and the <hi>Grave</hi> giveth up the bodies of them that were buried in the earth. For that the <hi>Grave</hi> is here to be underſtood by <hi>death</hi> is evident, in that it is a place of the dead diſtinguiſhed both from the <hi>Sea,</hi> and alſo from <hi>Hell.</hi> But there is no other recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104168:65"/>of the dead, beſides theſe twain, ſave only the <hi>Grave.</hi> Thus we finde that <hi>Job</hi> doth by <hi>death,</hi> underſtand the <hi>Grave, Chap.</hi> 27.15. When he ſaith of the wicked man, <hi>that thoſe that remain of him ſhall be buried in death, and his widows ſhall not weep.</hi> Finally <hi>Hell</hi> (not <hi>Hell-fire</hi>) giveth up the ſouls both of them that were drowned in the Sea, (under which name all waters are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and alſo of them that were buried in the earth. For that <hi>Hell</hi> is deſigned to be the manſion of ſeparated Souls, appeareth from the words of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.31. Who ſpeaking out of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> concerning the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>that his ſoul was not left in hell, neither did his fleſh ſee corruption.</hi> And alſo from that paſſage of <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 30.3. <hi>O Lord, thou haſt brought up my ſoul from Hell, thou haſt kept me alive that I ſhould not go down into the pit.</hi> For that I have rightly rendred the words in ſaying <hi>from hell,</hi> and not <hi>from the Grave</hi> is manifeſt both from the Greek verſion, which here hath <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Beſides the books of the Old and New Teſtament, which are the rule by which the actions of men; that have had ſome form of Religion delivered by God, ſhall at length be examined, there is yet another Book open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the day of judgement, to wit, <hi>the Book of life,</hi> wherein whoſoever have not their names written, are ſaid
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104168:66"/>to be caſt into the Lake of fire. From whence it may be rightly concluded, that as the want of being enrolled in that Book was above in the thirteenth and alſo in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth <hi>Chapters</hi> alleged, as the Cauſe why ſo many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt groſly in admiring and worſhipping the Beaſt, ſo is it here why ſo many are thrown into the Lake of Fire, in that it is altogether impoſſible for ſuch perſons to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that piety, to which the Promiſe of eternal Life is annexed. As for the place of the Lake of Fire that is here ſo much ſpoken of, were it part of the World it would of neceſſity periſh with the World, which (as we have before evinced) is to be aboliſhed.

                  <p>WHat I before ſaid touching the orderly courſe held by <hi>John</hi> in ſetting down, his Prophecies, is here worthy again to be obſerved. For having in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Chapter</hi> deſcribed the abolition of Heaven and Earth, he now mentioneth the <hi>new Heaven</hi> and the <hi>new Earth,</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:104168:66"/>that are to ſucceed in their place. And he therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that he had ſeen this <hi>new Heaven</hi> and this <hi>new Earth,</hi> (though to this very day the old ones ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue) becauſe they were repreſented to him in a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. <hi>There be ſome of them that are ſtanding here, who ſhall not taſte of Death, till they ſee the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.</hi> Not that any of them were to remain alive to the end of the World, for both the Scripture and the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory teſtifie the contrary, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe about eight days after he vouchſafed to three of them a ſight of that glory wherein he ſhall come as King to judge the World, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.27, 28, 29, 30. But for as much as many endeavour to obſcure this paſſage of the <hi>Revelation</hi> with their forced Allegories, let us confirm the plain and literal meaning thereof by what the Scripture elſewhere ſpeaketh concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribing the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the alteration that ſhall happen to the World thereby, telleth the pious <hi>Jews</hi> to whom he directeth his Letters, that <hi>the Day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the Night, in the which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo and the Works therein ſhall be burnt up. Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for and haſting unto the coming of the Day of God, wherein the Heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheleſs we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe, look for new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13. Is it poſſible that any thing ſhould more plainly and poſitively be delivered, to ſhew that the Heavens and the Earth, which now are, ſhall be diſſolved by Fire, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and <hi>new Heavens</hi> together with a <hi>new Earth</hi> be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104168:67"/>created of God in their room? Yea, was not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine long before taught by two ſacred Writers of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> to the latter of which the words of <hi>Peter</hi> (whileſt he ſpeaketh of Gods Promiſe touching a <hi>new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and a <hi>new Earth</hi>) ſeem to relate? For the divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the 102. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> directing his ſpeech to God, ſaith in the 25. and 26. <hi>Verſes</hi> thereof, <hi>Of old thou haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth: and the Heavens are the Work of thine Hands. They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a Garment: as a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed.</hi> Which paſſage doth not onely tell us in plain words that the Heavens and the Earth ſhall periſh, but with all inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that <hi>new Heavens</hi> and a <hi>new Earth</hi> ſhall be created, whileſt it ſaith, that <hi>God ſhall change the Heavens and the Earth, when grown old, as a Veſture.</hi> For in the change of an old Veſture, a new one is taken in its ſtead. Likewiſe the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 65.17. bringeth in God, ſaying, <hi>Behold, I create new Heavens, and a new Earth: and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into minde;</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 66.22. God, to comfort the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpeaketh thus, <hi>As the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the new Earth, which I will make, ſhall remain before me: ſo ſhall your ſeed and your name remain.</hi> Are not three ſuch Witneſſes as theſe ſufficient to confirm the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we have given on the foreſaid paſſage of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation?</hi> yea, doth not the very cloſe of the <hi>Verſe</hi> evince it, when it is ſaid, <hi>The Sea is no more?</hi> For ſeeing in the World to come there is no place for Commerce and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, to what purpoſe ſhould there be any Sea, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for a more eaſie and compendious paſſage from one Countrey to another, that ſo Men may be ſupplyed with ſuch Commodities as they want? But if any one here object that he cannot imagine any more need of a <hi>new Heaven</hi> and a <hi>new Earth,</hi> than of a <hi>new Sea,</hi> I anſwer, that it doth not therefore follow that they are all alike, in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104168:67"/>that it is expreſly denyed that there ſhall be any more Sea, but on the contrrary it is plainly affirmed that there ſhall be a <hi>new Heaven</hi> and a <hi>new Earth.</hi> Neither hath God left us wholly ignorant concerning the uſe of the <hi>new Earth,</hi> (and conſequently of the <hi>new Heaven,</hi> which will in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood be ſubſervient thereunto, as the old Heaven is to the old Earth) as appeareth from the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21, 22. where he ſaith, <hi>The earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Creature waiteth for the Manifeſtation of the Sons of God. For the Creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope: Becauſe the Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Children of God. For we know that the whole Creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</hi> Now ſeeing the Creatures that here expect ſo earneſtly and groan to be delivered from vanity, are twice plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Saints and Children of God, is it not thereby manifeſt that the other living Creatures which God created, ſhall, after the Saints are once clothed with immortality, be (though not in their former Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, yet in others of the ſame kinde) made immortal as well as they, and conſequently live upon the <hi>new Earth,</hi> or can any other ſenſe be put upon the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> without running into Abſurdities?</p>

                  <p>In the ſame manner that <hi>John</hi> had before ſeen the <hi>new Heaven</hi> and the <hi>new Earth,</hi> doth he here ſee the <hi>new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> onely this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is already in being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104168:68"/>called <hi>New,</hi> becauſe it is ſo to the Saints when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereinto in the life to come. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> before <hi>Ananias</hi> was in very deed come to him, had already ſeen him in a viſion entring in and laying his hand upon him, that he might receive his ſight. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11, 12. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the knowledge or the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is of ſo great importance, without which neither can the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſaints be rightly apprehended, nor their faith, as wanting a ſolid foundation, be firm and ſtable, we will evince out of the Scripture that by the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is not meant the Church, but (as it is here expreſly termed) a City which God hath reſerved in heaven for the Saints. To omit therefore the obſervation, that may to this effect be rightly deduced from the very name of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which being in the Hebrew of the dual number, ſign fieth that there are two Cities known by that appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,, the Teſtimonies taken out of the divine Author to the Hebrews, will abundantly confirm our aſſertion. For he ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.9, 10. <hi>By faith Abraham ſojourned in the land of promiſe as in a ſtrange countrey, dwelling in Tabernacles with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>heirs with him of the ſame promiſe. For he looked for a City which hath founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> Certainly a City that is oppoſed to Tabernacles, as having foundations whereof they are deſtitute, and whoſe builder and maker is God himſelf, is a City truly and properly ſo called. Again in the 13.14, 15. and 16. <hi>verſes</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> he ſpeaketh thus, <hi>All theſe,</hi> (namely <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob) died in faith, not having received the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but having ſeen them a far of, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a countrey. And truly if they had been mindful of that countrey, from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104168:68"/>but now they deſire abetter countrey, that is an heavenly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is not aſhamed to be called their God: For he hath prepared for them a City.</hi> You ſee by this that God hath provided for the Saints a City, which is their heavenly Countrey; and that the Patriarchs believed and longed for the ſame, although they had received no promiſes of it, but only ſeen them a far off, and that they ſhewed their faith and longing by confeſſing themſelves to be ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth. How much then doth their practice condem many Chriſtians, who having received expreſs promiſes of ſuch a City and Kingdome, are ſo far from longing after it, as that they deny that there is any ſuch place, turning it into an allegory and meer notion! The ſame divine Author further ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.22, 23. <hi>Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerablt company of Angels; To the general aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> In which words the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem</hi> is not only diſtinguiſhed, but alſo parted from the Church, by the interpoſal of another thing, to which we have acceſs in the Goſpel, to wit, <hi>the myriads of Angels,</hi> ſo that there remaineth no tergiverſation, but that the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> and the Church of God muſt of neceſſity be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for two different things. Finally he ſaith <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.13.14. <hi>Let us go forth unto him,</hi> (that is, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>) <hi>without the camp, bearing his reproach: For here we have no continuing City, but we ſeek one to come.</hi> Here alſo the City is diſtinguiſhed from the Church, for none can deny that they which ſeek for that City to come are the Church, whereas the City it ſelf is the thing ſought for. It further appeareth from the firſt clauſe of this fourteenth <hi>verſe,</hi> to which the ſecond hath relation, that a City truly and properly ſo called is here meant. But were all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104168:69"/>theſe Teſtimonies laid aſide, the very deſcent of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> out of heaven (whereby the <hi>New heaven</hi> is to be underſtood, as the foregoing <hi>verſe</hi> doth ſhew) ſufficiently argueth, that not the Church, but a City is thereby intended. For the Church conſiſting of faithful men and women, that were both generated and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated on the earth, and there have their continual abode, cannot without great abſurdity be ſaid to deſcend out of heaven, much leſs out of the <hi>New heaven,</hi> which is not yet in being. Moreover the deſcription of the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſet down in this and the following <hi>Chapter,</hi> will fully evidence to us both how truly I affirm it to be a very City, and alſo how aptly <hi>John</hi> compareth it to a Bride, that is dreſſed and adorned for her husband.</p>

                  <p>The voice that is here heard out of heaven, and which in likelyhood, proceedeth from Angels, (for God is brought in ſpeaking immediately after, and Angels are elſewhere found to congratulate the ſalvation of men, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11, 13, 14.) confirmeth what I before aſſerted, that by the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is meant a place, and not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104168:69"/>the Church or people of God: for it is ſtiled, upon the deſcent thereof out of heaven, <hi>the Tabernacle of God that is with men,</hi> and ſo is a thing different from the men themſelves, of whom the Church conſiſteth. Again, though the Church be ſometimes in the Scripture known by the name of a <hi>Temple,</hi> yet have I not met with any inſtance where it is called a <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> Nor is it abſurd that the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> though a City that hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, ſhould here be termed <hi>a Tabernacle;</hi> for being deſcribed as deſcending down from God out of heaven, it doth (contrary to other Cities) remove from place to place, as <hi>Tabernacles</hi> or <hi>Tents</hi> are wont to do. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that they enjoy, who are admitted into this <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> is to have the very <hi>perſon</hi> of God among them. For ſo much is ſignified by thoſe words, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>God himſelf ſhall be with them:</hi> which alſo intimate that during the ſtate of this life <hi>God himſelf</hi> is not with his people, however his favour and aſſiſtance be with them. Neither let any one check at that expreſſion of mine touching the <hi>perſon</hi> of God, for it is borrowed from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Where Chriſt is called the expreſs Image of his <hi>perſon.</hi> When God ſhall thus be preſent with the Saints in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhall thereby become their <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Sovereign benefactour</hi> in the moſt perfect manner. For if according to the intimation of the divine Author to the Hebrews, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.16. God be called the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> becauſe he hath prepared for them a City, how much better may he be called their God, when he vouchſafeth to them the enjoyment both of that City, and alſo of his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal preſence therein? For ſeeing that in his preſence there is fulneſs of joy, as <hi>David</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.11. it muſt needs come to paſs that the Saints ſhall by the means thereof be exempted from all miſery whatſoever, and (as it is here expreſſed) neither weep, nor ſorrow,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104168:70"/>nor cry, nor ſuffer either death, or pain any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former ſtate and condition of men, wherein all theſe things had place, is now quite done away. Where let it by the way be marked, that when it is in the Text ſaid, <hi>There ſhall be no more death,</hi> this doth of it ſelf put it out of doubt, that what is here ſpoken of men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not this life, but that which is to come, according to the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelf, who telleth us in the Goſpel according to <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 20.35, 36.

                  <p>The making of all things new, is altogether neceſſary to the happineſs of the Saints; yet ſeeing this was a thing, which for the greatneſs thereof was likely to finde but little credit amongſt men (as we by experience finde it come to paſs) God is not content with what others from heaven had ſpoken of it, but doth himſelf ſay to <hi>John, Behold, I make all things new;</hi> and not only ſo, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth John to write the ſame, that it may remain upon Record for ever, alledging this as the reaſon, namely becauſe the words which both he himſelf and others had uttered concerning this matter were <hi>true and faithful.</hi> Which Epithets are not therefore uſed by God, that he might only ſignifie that there was no falſhood in the words aforeſaid, (for then what will become of the emphaſis that lieth in the word <hi>theſe,</hi> it being impoſſible that any ſpeech proceeding from God ſhould be falſe?) but rather to intimate that there was nothing in them obſcure and uncertain, as it fareth with ſundry other ſayings of God, which are very doubtful and hard to be underſtood. Thus when <hi>Daniel</hi> had declared to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> very plainly, both his dream and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof, he ſaith in the cloſe of his ſpeech, (as the Greek verſion, not varying from the Original Syriack, hath it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>The dream is true, and the interpretation thereof faithful,</hi> or <hi>ſure, Chap.</hi> 2.45. It is alſo ſaid <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.26. after that the viſions hapning to <hi>Daniel</hi> at evening on his bed, and in the morning when he was riſen up from thence, had been fully explained, <hi>the viſion of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true.</hi> Finally when <hi>Daniel Chap.</hi> 7. had ſeen certain viſions, and was at firſt troubled about the ſence of them, but afterwards underſtood it, he writeth thus, <hi>verſe</hi> 16.17, 18, 19. <hi>I came neer unto one of them that ſtood by, and aſked him the truth of all this, ſo he told me and made me how the interpretation of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104168:71"/>things Theſe great Beaſts, which are four, are four Kings, which ſhall ariſe out of the earth. But the Saints of the moſt high ſhall take the Kingdom, and poſſeſs the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. Then I would know the truth of the fourth beaſt, which was diverſe from all the others.</hi> From whence it is evident that to know the <hi>truth</hi> of viſions, is to underſtand the interpretation, and meaning of them. Wherefore to return to the foreſaid paſſage of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> when it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe words are true and faithful,</hi> it is all one as if it had been ſaid, <hi>Theſe words are plain, and certain, and to be taken as they ſound:</hi> and conſequently ſuch as go about to turn the prophecy touching the <hi>New heaven</hi> and the <hi>New earth,</hi> and the deſcent of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and the making of all things new into an allegory, do exceedingly erre from the true and genuine meaning thereof. But God hath not yet ceaſed to inculcate the making of all things new, becauſe of the infinite conſequence thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſhew how certain the ſame is, he ſpeaketh of it though to come, as if it were already paſt, ſaying, <hi>it is done:</hi> he alſo backeth it with a ſtrong reaſon, the better to imprint the belief thereof, in the minds of men, whileſt he ſaith that <hi>he is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.</hi> The connexion of which reaſon with the thing to be proved thereby, is this, that ſeeing God is not wont, like frail and fickle man to do his work by halfes, but throughly to effect them, it cannot be but that having once begun the ſalvation of the Saints, he ſhould at length accompliſh the ſame, and in order thereunto make all things new. God having thus fully declared his purpoſe to make all things new, doth afterwards invite men to come and partake of <hi>the water of life freely,</hi> without money and without price. The fountain, where this water ſpringeth, is in the beginning of the following <hi>Chapter</hi> ſaid to be <hi>the throne of God and the Lamb,</hi> and therefore we are not to underſtand any water figuratively
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104168:71"/>ſo taken, but ſuch as being received into the body, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eternal Life in thoſe that drink it. But the Invitation to drink of this Water is made to none by God, ſave ſuch as <hi>thirſt after it,</hi> and ſo have an ardent deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of the ſame. What ſhall we then ſay to thoſe, who are ſo far from longing to drink of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they believe there is no ſuch thing, turning all that is ſaid thereof into an Allegory? In the next place God promiſeth to them that overcome, that <hi>they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things,</hi> namely, both the Heaven and the Earth that now are, and alſo thoſe that are to come. For they (as I have before ſhewn) being ſuch as lay down their Lives for the Goſpel, have a Privilege above others that dy in the Lord, in that they are admitted to reign with Chriſt in Heaven long before the general Reſurrection, and ſo like him are the Heirs of all things, and Sons of God in a more perfect manner than the reſt of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who though they enjoy eternal Life with Chriſt, yet are not vouchſafed the Honour to ſit with him in his Throne. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.21. But as God is the <hi>God</hi> or <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Benefactour</hi> of thoſe that ſuffer Death for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Truth; ſo on the contrary, ſuch as dare not out of cowardice to partake in the afflictions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or refuſe to believe therein, or are filthy in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or unjuſtly deprive others of their Life, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file themſelves with Women, or uſe the confederacy of evil ſpirits to produce marvellous effects, or worſhip either falſe Gods, or the true God in a falſe manner, by Images which they make to themſelves, or have guile in their mouth, not ſpeaking as they mean, have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſigned of God unto them in the Lake of Fire, which is here again ſaid to be the ſecond Death, and that ſuitably enough.

For the fine Linen is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi> So that the Scripture it ſelf thereby directeth us by the <hi>Lambs Wife</hi> in the ſaid place to underſtand the Church, howbeit not the Church abiding on the Earth (of which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſpeak) but reigning with Chriſt in Heaven; whereas, when in the ninth <hi>Verſe</hi> of this 21. <hi>Chapter</hi> the Angel promiſeth to ſhew unto <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> he preſently after preſents to his view a great City deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Heaven from God. Which doth ſufficiently teach us, that by the <hi>Lambs Wife</hi> here is not as formerly meant the Church, but a very City, wherein the Saints ſhall hereafter dwell. For though the <hi>Wife of Chriſt</hi> doth by a more exact Metaphor ſignifie the Church, yet doth not this hinder, but that by a leſs exact one, the City alſo to which the Church hath relation, may be ſignified by the ſame, yea, nothing is more uſual in the Scripture, (as I have before proved) than to repreſent Cities under the notion of Women. Thus we ſaw that the polluted and foul City of <hi>Rome</hi> was called an <hi>Harlot, Chap.</hi> 17. why then may not that holy and undefiled City, the <hi>new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> be ſtyled the <hi>Lambs Wife?</hi> By this means we come to the right underſtanding of that paſſage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>The</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>that is above, is free, which is the Mother of us all.</hi> For in as much as the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not onely inſeparably annexed to Chriſt, but alſo at his diſpoſal, and ſo elegantly called his Wife, ſhe muſt needs be the Mother of all Chriſtians, who are both regenerated by the propoſal thereof, and deſigned to be the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he ſaith, that the Angel <hi>carried him away in the ſpirit to a great and high Mountain,</hi> (from whence a fairer Proſpect might be had) <hi>and ſhewed him that great

Onely let it be obſerved how God vouchſafeth to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eſpecial honour, above any other Nation under Heaven, as having inſcribed the names of the twelve Patriarchs, (from whom their ſeveral Tribes are denominated) upon the Gates of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> From whence it may be collected, that God ordained thoſe Patriarchs to Salvation from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For it would be ridiculous to imagine, that God would write the names of ſuch men on the Gates of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as were not to have any portion therein. And this affordeth another collection (whereby that is confirmed which we formerly diſcourſed upon the 8. <hi>Verſe</hi> of the 17. <hi>Chapter</hi>) that all who are to inherit the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were by name appointed thereunto from the Foundation of the World. For what reaſon is conceivable, why God ſhould in this manner deſign the twelve Patriarchs, and not likewiſe all the reſt of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens?

But for as much as the highneſs of the Gates is not afterwards ſet down, we muſt needs remain ignorant thereof, and ought to content our ſelves with the meaſure of the Wall, wherein
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104168:74"/>it is contained. The City therefore lying four-ſquare, (for that is the fitteſt Figure for reſt, as Roundneſs beſt agreeth with Motion) is twelve thouſand Furlongs broad, twelve thouſand long, and twelve thouſand high, (which after the proportion of eight Furlongs to a Mile, maketh fifteen hundred Miles every way) and therefore it might well above be called <hi>the great City.</hi> And indeed the compaſs thereof ought to be very large, in that it is to contain all the Faithful that ever were from the beginning of the World to the end thereof. As for the Wall, it is a hundred forty four Cubits, after the Cubit of a Man; in whoſe ſimilitude the Angel here appeareth. But the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of an ordinary man, from the elbow to the top of the middle finger, is accounted half a yard, and ſo the Wall is ſeventy two yards. But in as much as it is not here expreſſed, whether this meaſure pertaineth to the height, or to the thickneſs thereof, (for as for the length it muſt needs be greater than that of the City it ſelf which the Wall doth encompaſs) it will be beſt to refer it unto both, and ſo to reckon the Wall ſeventy two yards high, and as many broad. By which means that will be verified which was before ſpoken of it, namely, that it was <hi>great and high.</hi> The matter whereof this Wall is made, as to the main Body thereof, is ſaid to conſiſt of Jaſper, which is a ſtone moſt precious, and caſting a moſt delicate luſtre, otherwiſe the Luminary of the City would not have been like to it. The Foundations of the Wall being in number twelve, conſiſt of twelve different precious Stones, which are here particularly named. But ſeeing it is hard (if not impoſſible) for us exactly to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and deſcribe the ſame; (as the jarring of thoſe that have written of them doth imply) nor would the right di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of them, if attained, advance our ſpiritual edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in that it appeareth not from the Text, that any Myſtery lyeth couched under them, I will omit any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104168:74"/>diſcourſe of them, and haſten to that which is further related concerning the glory of the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem.</hi> The twelve Gates thereof are ſaid to conſiſt of one intire Pearl a piece, and the City it ſelf together with the Street thereof to be of pure Gold, tranſparent as Glaſs; which is of ſuch rarity, as neither Nature nor Art is able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

In which light of the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſtreameth from God and Chriſt, and is of a more pure and exhilarating nature than that of the Sun and Moon, ſhall the <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> of them that are ſaved, converſe. For that the word <hi>Nation</hi> here uſed, doth elſewhere alſo in the Scripture ſometimes denote no other than a <hi>Company</hi> or <hi>Multitude,</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:104168:75"/>and not all the People dwelling in the compaſs of ſuch a Countrey, or derived from ſuch an Anceſtour, is evident from that paſſage of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.9. where writing to the believing <hi>Jews</hi> of the diſperſion of <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Ye are a choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation.</hi> And this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>John,</hi> wherein he ſaith, that <hi>the Nations of them that are ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of the new</hi> Jeruſalem, doth plainly put a difference between the Church and her. For the Nations of them that are ſaved, are the Church, and therefore the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> in whoſe light they walk, is the place of their abode, and ſo a City, as it is here again and again entituled. To render which City yet more glorious, it is ſaid, that <hi>the Kings of the Earth ſhall bring their glory and honour thereinto.</hi> For in as much as the virtue of pious Kings, both for the difficulty that there is in attaining and exerciſing the ſame, becauſe of the extraordinary Temptations to which their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth expoſe them, and alſo for the great influence it hath upon the World, doth far exceed that of other men; hence it is that God, who renders to all men according to their Works, will at the laſt Day confer a greater meaſure of glory and honour upon ſuch Kings, and therefore their luſtre will in a ſignal manner adorn the <hi>new Jeruſalem.</hi> Howbeit the glory and honour of the Nations that are ſaved, when it alſo (as it is here written) ſhall be brought into the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> will add no little ſplendour thereunto. Moreover, the Gates of this City ſhall never be ſhut. For ſeeing the Gates of Cities are wont to be ſhut at night onely, and here ſhall be perpetual Day, in that the glory of God doth enlighten it without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there is no place left for the ſhutting of the Gates belonging to the <hi>new Jeruſalem.</hi> But though the Gates ly continually open, yet ſhall not all perſons whatſoever enter thereinto. For whoſoever, having been of a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104168:75"/>life, and addicted either to Debauchery or Lying, would by his abode defile that holy place, he is debarred entrance thereinto, and ſuch onely admitted who have been pure and undefiled in their ways; which Purity is here intimated by ſaying, that <hi>they are written in the Lambs Book of Life,</hi> and conſequently the Cauſe why any man attaineth Holineſs of Life, is the enrolling of his name in the Book of Life, to which agreeth that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and unblameable before him in love.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not here ſay, that they were choſen, becauſe God foreſaw they would be holy, but to the end they might be ſo. He alſo ſpeaketh to the ſame purpoſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. where he ſaith, <hi>God hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not according to our Works,</hi> (and therefore not of foreſeen good Works,) <hi>but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So that none can with reaſon deny that there was a tree of life plainly and properly ſo called, which grew in the earthly <hi>Paradiſe</hi> or <hi>Orchard,</hi> where God placed <hi>Adam:</hi> no more may he deny that there is ſuch a Tree in the heavenly <hi>Paradiſe</hi> or <hi>Orchard,</hi> the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> It is further here told us, (to the end we ſhould reſt in the plain and obvious ſence of the place) that the Tree of life beareth a different kinde of fruit every moneth, which muſt needs tend to the great delight of them that ſhall eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in that men are much taken with the variety of their food: where by the way let it be obſerved, that the Tree of life is the meaſure of time in the world to come, for putting forth twelve ſorts of fruits ſucceſſively, it maketh the twelve moneths, and conſequenrly the year that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of them. But it will perhaps be objected, in oppoſition to what I affirm out of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> about eating and drinking in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. ſaith, <hi>Meats for the belly, and the belly for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104168:77"/>meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of worldly meats, and that veſſel which God hath made in the natural body to receive them, ſo that this pertaineth not to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual body, (whereof mention is made in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.44.) nor to thoſe heavenly cates, whereof <hi>John</hi> here diſcourſeth. For certainly that there ſhall be eating and drinking in the kingdom of heaven, is elſewhere ſo plainly delivered, that interpreters ſhew themſelves ridiculous, whilſt they go about to impoſe another ſence upon the words. Hear therefore what Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.15.16, 17, 18. <hi>I have exceedingly deſired to eat this paſſover with you before I ſuffer. For I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. And he took the cup and gave thanks, and ſaid, take this, and divide it among your ſelves. For I ſay unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God ſhall come.</hi> Doth not this place ſignifie that Chriſt ſhall eat of an heavenly paſſover with his Diſciples, as he did of an earthly one a little before his death, and ſhall alſo drink wine with them? To the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaketh to them afterwards, in the 28.29. and 30. <hi>verſes</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto yon a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me: That ye may eat and drink with me in my Kingdom.</hi> And alſo <hi>Math.</hi> 26.29. ſaying, <hi>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom.</hi> Doth not this ſhew, (as I before argued out of <hi>Luke</hi>) that Chriſt ſhall drink with his Diſciples new wine in the kingdom of God, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he drank old wine with them at his laſt ſupper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, and conſequently the tree of life is for one moneth a vine, yielding a liquor ſo excellent, that it needeth not age to bring it to perfection, but being only
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104168:78"/>preſſed out of the grapes into the cup, is the moſt rich and delicate wine that can be imagined? but the tree of life affordeth to the Nations of them that are ſaved, (for only ſuch Nations are here underſtood, as appeareth from the four and twentieth <hi>verſe</hi> of the precedent <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) it doth, I ſay, afford not only meat and drink but medicine alſo. For when any diſtemper beginneth to creep on the Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the leaves of this tree being uſed, do diſcharge the ſame. By which means they remain for ever free from ſickneſs and death. Howbeit the manner how theſe leaves are uſed, whether they be inwardly taken, (which is the more probable opinion) or outwardly applied, is uncertain, and ſo ought to be paſſed over, as alſo the buſineſs of <hi>evacuation.</hi> For there is no mention thereof in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much leſs of the maner wherein it ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that it becometh not us to make any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry thereinto. But if any ſhall yet reply, and ſay, that what hath been ſpoken of meat and drink and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, to be in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> doth make the future happineſs of the Saints to appear ſomewhat groſs: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is not for us to deviſe what is ſuitable for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of them that ſhal inherit the Kingdom of heaven, but to reſtin that which God hath prepared for them. He could no doubt have given them ſuch an immortality as needed no outward ſupply, but could have ſuſtained it ſelf upon its own inward principles, without either meat, or drink, or medicine, but he hath thought it fit to order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter otherwiſe, as appeareth by the declaration that he himſelf hath made thereof in the Scripture. And ſhall we preſume to be wiſer than he, and accuſe him as not knowing how to make his people happy in the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, by imagining ſuch a felicity as is not recorded in his word, and wreſting that which is there deſcribed by our exotick interpretations? Certainly ſeeing the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104168:78"/>Scripture teſtifieth <hi>that the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men,</hi> it becometh us to aſſent to that which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, though ſeeming fooliſh to us, rather then affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be wiſe above what is written, to follow the groundleſs imaginations of our own heart.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104168:79"/>greateſt affection. But leaſt any one ſhould turn that which is here delivered concerning the Throne of God, into an allegory, becauſe a Throne is ſometimes put for Royal power, let us evince both out of the circumſtances of the place, and alſo from other paſſages of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God hath in very deed a throne in heaven. For firſt if by the Throne of God ſhould here be only meant Royal power, the words would carry no emphaſis with them, when it is ſaid that <hi>the Throne of God ſhall be in the New Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeeing the Royal power of God extendeth it ſelf to all places alike. 2 The Throne of God is here as properly taken as that of Chriſt, whileſt it is ſaid, <hi>The Throne of God and the Lamb.</hi> But Chriſt being the ſon of man, cannot be denied to ſit as a King upon a throne properly ſo taken. Wherefore neither can God likewiſe. Both which are confirmed by that paſſage of the divine Author to the Hebrews, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.2. Where it is ſaid, <hi>That Jeſus ſat down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi> 3. The throne of God hath been ſeen, and ſo is properly to be underſtood, as thoſe things that fall under the ſence are wont to be. This is manifeſt from the firſt <hi>verſe,</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> where <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw a River of water of life proceeding out of the Throne of God and the Lamb.</hi> And alſo from the eleventh <hi>verſe</hi> of the twentieth <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the very colour of his Throne is alſo expreſſed, for ſo <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw a great white Throne and him that ſat on it, from whoſe face the earth and the heaven fled away.</hi> And finally from that notable viſion of <hi>Micajah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19. who ſaith to <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Hear thou the word of the Lord: I ſaw the Lord ſitting on his Throne, and all the hoſt of heaven ſtanding by him, on his right hand, and on his left.</hi> 4. It is ſaid of Chriſt (as we before cited it out of the Epiſtle of the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 12.2.) that Chriſt ſat down <hi>on the right hand</hi> of the Throne of God; which could not be true, were the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104168:79"/>Throne of God any other then a ſeat. 5. God is in the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> frequently known by the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>of him that ſitteth upon the throne.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.13. and 6.16. and 7.15. But this would be an impertinent deſcription of God, were there in very deed no Throne in heaven whereon he ſitteth. 6. God is ſaid <hi>to have prepared his Throne in the heavens, Pſalm.</hi> 103.19, which will not admit any other ſence, but that he hath made there a Royal ſeat for himſelf. By all theſe arguments it appeareth that to ſay God doth not in very deed ſit on a Throne in heaven, is to contradict both the Scripture, and our very ſenſes.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104168:80"/>were they now admitted to the very perſon of God, their eyes were not fit of themſelves to behold ſo ſpiritual and glorious an object.

Thus (as we have above diſcourſed) the name of the Beaſt was ſet upon the foreheads of men to ſignifie that they were ſuch as ſerved and worſhipped him.

                  <p>To ſerve God and perform virtuous Actions in hope of a Reward, is a thing very lawfull, as being commended to us by the Example of holy <hi>Moſes,</hi> who as the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> writeth, <hi>accounted the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures in</hi> Egypt: <hi>for he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the Recompenſe of the Reward, Chap.</hi> 11.26.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104168:84"/>by the Example of one that was greater and holier than <hi>Moſes,</hi> even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who, as the ſaid divine Writer teſtifieth, <hi>did for the joy that was ſet before him, deſpiſe the ſhame and endure the Croſs, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God, Chap.</hi> 12.2. Neither is it onely lawfull, but altogether neceſſary, in that we cannot otherwiſe ſerve God in Faith, and ſo pleaſe him; for the foreſaid Authour plainly telleth us, that <hi>without Faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God: for he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, Chap.</hi> 11.6. No marvel therefore if the Angel doth here pronounce them happy, who do the Commandments of Chriſt to this very end, <hi>that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter through the Gates into the City.</hi> Which words do beyond all gain ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evince that there is in very deed a <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> and alſo a <hi>City</hi> reſerved in Heaven for the Saints, where this Tree groweth, and that the hope to eat of this Tree, and enter into this City is and ought to be the chief Spur to the performance of our duty. So that if any man ſhall of his own head either think to do the Commandments of Chriſt without having an eye to any Recompenſe at all, or at leaſt ſhall deſpiſe the Reward here propoſed as too mean for his curioſity, he is in danger to come ſhort of happineſs. It is further apparent from the Angels words, that if any man promiſe to himſelf the happineſs here held forth, and yet doth not the Commandments of Chriſt, either becauſe he thinketh another hath done them in his ſtead, and ſo he need not put himſelf to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing them, or that a deſire to do them is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or upon what other ground ſoever he imagineth that eternal Life may be attained upon eaſier terms than by doing the Commandments of Chriſt, he deceiveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for the Angel here telleth us plainly, that ſuch as obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt, but are either of a profane
<pb facs="tcp:104168:85"/>or ſnarling diſpoſition, or are in league with evil ſpirits, or pollute themſelves with Women, or unjuſtly deprive others of their life, or worſhip either falſe Gods, or the true God in a falſe manner, or are addicted to Lying, ſhall utterly be excluded from enjoying either the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> or the <hi>holy City,</hi> the Paradiſe of God, where it groweth. Finally, it appeareth from the foreſaid paſſage, that the doing of Chriſt's Commandments is that which giveth men a Right to eternal Life.</p>

For when Jeſus calleth himſelf <hi>the Root of</hi> David, we muſt not underſtand ſuch a Root, out of which <hi>David</hi> himſelf did grow, for by this account Jeſus will be, not the Son, but the Father of <hi>David,</hi> which is repugnant to the Scripture, and altogether unfit to ſhew his Authority over the Churches of God. Wherefore he is ſuch a Root, as ſprung from <hi>David,</hi> and was propagated out of his Seed. And this is taught us in the Text it ſelf, where after that Jeſus had called himſelf <hi>the Root of</hi> David, he doth by way of explication preſently add that he was <hi>his
<pb facs="tcp:104168:85"/>Off-ſpring,</hi> The third deſcription, which is ſubjoyned to the two former ones, whereof we have treated, doth further ſet out the dignity of Chriſt, declaring him to be crowned with glory and honour, and that in an eminent manner, as the morning ſtar doth far exceed in luſtre the other heavenly Lamps.</p>

This being ſo, what will become of them at the laſt day, who have rejected this whole book from the Canon of holy ſcripture, pretending it was written, not by that holy Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> but by ſome vile perſon, when in the mean time the name of <hi>John</hi> is often there expreſſed, as the penman thereof, and the divine excellency of the things contained in the book ſufficiently demonſtrateth that it came originally from God? what likewiſe ſhall we think of thoſe, who have ſo ſhamefully abuſed the book of this prophecy, as that they durſt to make it ſubſervient to their own paſſions and worldly intereſts, impoſing ſuch gloſſes on the ſame, as have no hint or footſtep in the holy Text, and that on purpoſe to blacken ſome either perſon, or party, (with whom they are angry) and render them odious in the ſight of all men?
